			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><span class="char-style-override6"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" /></span>In this book, I wish to explain a concept of governance I call “anthrostate.” In simple terms, an anthrostate is a virtual state whose laws apply only to individuals, not to geographic areas. I am not a proponent of this idea or a detractor. I’m just a nerd with a thought experiment and a lot of time on his hands. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Much of science fiction has to do with the fact that what is possible often becomes typical. In this way, science fiction often smooths the introduction of new technologies by exploring their meaning, ethics, sanguine visions, and dystopian possibilities in advance of their existence. Speculative science fiction has in this way both entertained and aided civilization. H.G. Wells’ The World Set Free did not prevent nuclear war (nor did it accurately predict the nature of such weapons), but it nevertheless helped develop an ethical stance toward the dark days to come. Indeed, through the influence it had on Leo Szilard, Wells’ book helped both to create and subdue atomic warfare. George Orwell’s 1984 has not entirely prevented the rise of powerful state surveillance apparatuses, but it has given us an understanding of their danger and a four-numeral code by which to signify our worst fears.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Wells was writing in the age of the rise of science in warfare. Orwell was writing in the age of the rise of psychology in warfare and governance. It seems to me we are now in an era of discretization of experience. Thanks to advances in computing and manufacturing, variety and personalization of experience are everywhere. In a certain sense, the greatest of modern luxuries is choice &mdash; one’s options for food, entertainment, field of endeavor, and even mate choice seem to grow year by year. As 3D printing becomes more commonplace, it may be the case that almost every aspect of life is personalized in the same way Internet search and social media are today.<a href="#calibre_link-1">(1)</a></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In other words, the trend of history is toward more individual choice and personalization of life experience. Clever software and cheap computing has made this trend exponential. Perhaps then it is only a matter of time before people begin to wonder why they can’t personalize their government too. That is the subject of “Polystate.”</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">I hope you will think of this book as a sort of “poli sci fi” work exploring a conception of government, largely in the abstract. For all that it may get wrong, it is educated speculation, and it is made in the recognition that anthrostates may well be a possibility in the near future and are therefore worth considering in the present.<span class="char-style-override7"></span></p>

			<p class="Basic-Paragraph5"><span class="char-style-override9"><br class="calibre2" /><br class="calibre2" /><br class="calibre2" /></span><span class="char-style-override4"><a id="calibre_link-9" class="calibre3"></a></span><span class="char-style-override10">Chapter 1: Terms and Conditions</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />Before I go forward, I wish to introduce three terms I have made up. My friends know I have a profound loathing for jargon. However, just as the Second Law of Thermodynamics technically permits occasional decrease in systemic entropy, now and then jargon can be used to increase clarity. I hope this is one of those rare times.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The three words I wish to introduce are “anthrostate,” “geostate,” and “polystate.”</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The first word is the major concept in this book. I define it thus: A set of laws and institutions that govern the behavior of individuals, but which do not govern a behavior within geographic borders. For example, suppose you subscribed to a fascist anthrostate. That would mean the rules of that fascist state apply to you, but may not apply to your neighbors. Perhaps your neighbors are citizens of a syndicalist geostate or a social democracy.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">This is opposed to the typical notion of statehood, which is the application of laws over the individuals who claim citizenship within a geographic area. In order to set the typical notion of statehood in juxtaposition to the anthrostate, the second term I introduce is “geostate.” When I say “geostate,” you should think of a typical nation, such as France, Japan, or Mexico.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The third term I wish to introduce is “polystate.” The polystate is simply the collection of anthrostates in a hypothetical human society. I believe that in any system of anthrostates it will be necessary to have certain overarching laws, which will be embodied in the polystate.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph5"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-10"></a><span class="char-style-override10">Chapter 2: What is a Geostate?</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />If you stop and think about it, a geostate is a strange entity. What exactly <span class="char-style-override11">is</span> an American? Is an American someone who lives inside a region bounded by certain latitudinal meridians? Is an American someone who obeys most of the laws of a certain geographic region, whether or not she is inside that region currently? Is an American someone who subscribes to a civic religion or speaks with a certain accent, or has a certain cultural vocabulary?</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The strange thing is that an American is all of those things. So, the geostate called America is a superposition of many institutions &mdash; legal, cultural, geographic, and so forth. Why should it be thus? Why should we suppose that a person who likes hot dogs, is familiar with a two-party electoral system, and believes Abraham Lincoln was a great man is necessarily someone who should live in a temperate climate in the Western hemisphere? Many cultural qualities of a society may be determined by arbitrary facts of geography. For example, it should not surprise us to learn that rules of social engagement differ between polar and equatorial societies. This is not to deny that history and culture and the choices of individuals matter, but rather to assert that many of the “essential” qualities of nationhood are not, in the long run, meaningful ones.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">More importantly, laws of nations change drastically over time. The structure of the modern Japanese state would not be recognizable to a medieval Japanese person. Slavery is considered antithetical to Americanness, yet it existed for nearly the first century of that nation. A Russian man who lived from 1900 to 2000 would have seen his state go from a monarchy to hopeful communism to a dictatorship to a nominal democracy, and yet might well consider himself “Russian” all the time.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In a sense, the experience of the state recapitulates the experience of the individual. I am not the person I was at age 10 &mdash; a fact I deduce from the lack of Star Wars posters on my wall. I am not the person I was at 20. In fact, I suspect I would not get along with those people particularly well. The state is not so different &mdash; America is America because it hasn’t stopped being America. The laws have changed dramatically, as has the religious makeup, the ethnic makeup, the population size, the urban-rural distribution, the geographic borders, and the cultural hallmarks. That is, a geostate continues to be itself only so long as there is not a discrete moment at which the people governed by it choose for it to change, usually at great cost of blood, treasure, and order.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">All this is to say simply that geostates are not entities pre-ordained by the human condition. They should not be taken as inevitable. We should especially consider the extent to which technology influences the meaning of geography. As technology changes, the meaning of locality changes. Seasonal produce is now year-round. Dispersed families can now see each other regularly. Even economic externalities may in time be rendered harmless by technology. As Gordon Tullock wrote in “What Should Government Do,” externalities that tend to be geographic in area such as pollution may simply be mitigated by new developments.<a href="#calibre_link-41">(1)</a> Indeed, development of society per se may help minimize such costs by limiting locality. In the year 1800, a New Yorker might have little desire to be taxed for a road in San Francisco. The price of that road is a cost to him with no direct benefit. The more interconnected society becomes, especially in terms of transportation speed and globalized commerce, the more palpable the effect of a crumbling California road becomes to a New Yorker, or perhaps even a Londoner or Parisian.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Another externality cited by Tullock is the natural monopoly. A natural monopoly is, in short, when a service or good is provided most efficiently by a single provider. Tullock’s claim is that a natural monopoly will (naturally) be run in an inefficient manner. If this is the case, government intervention may well be warranted. However, what if we consider the government of a geostate as having a natural monopoly over coercion? Does this produce an efficient outcome? Laws applied to diverse people necessarily contain inefficiencies. This is not necessarily a problem. Consider for example the case of drunk-driving laws. It may be the case that there are certain individuals who drive perfectly well at an illegal level of blood alcohol content. The law is unfair toward them compared with individuals who are more typical in their alcohol impairment.<a href="#calibre_link-42">(2)</a> Nevertheless, we consider it a good law because this externality is small when compared to the benefit. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">But, suppose we reversed the situation. Suppose the blood alcohol limit were set below a level where 95% of people could drive safely. In that case, the law might or might not be efficient, depending on the danger posed by the weak-livered 5%.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">If the cost of bargaining and lawmaking were not very high, the optimum outcome might be a law that that applies slightly differently to each person. This is only feasible with technology, but more on that later. Setting aside the normative question of whether it is desirable to have one law apply differently to individuals, a DUI law that scaled with tolerance and driving ability might be most efficient for all people.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Changing the laws (be they written down or just understood) under which you operate has always been difficult. In the modern world, you basically have two options &mdash; change location or change the laws in your geostate. The former is difficult, and the latter is practically impossible for most people.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It is not possible in a more or less uncorrupt geostate that I should have a different set of taxes and services than my neighbor<a href="#calibre_link-43">(3)</a>. This is true even if each of us would voluntarily choose different systems. I cannot, for example, say “Well, this year I wish to pay less in taxes, so please don’t have the police protect me.” In the geostate, I exist in the same set of laws as other full-fledged citizens.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">This is not inevitably the case, but it is certainly convenient. A massive bureaucracy would be required to have many overlapping varieties of law. As we shall see, this is a potential problem in a polystate, but it is not insurmountable.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph5"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-11"></a><span class="char-style-override10">Chapter 3: Approximate Anthrostates</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />Any system in which free association is allowed will possess something akin to anthrostates. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">For example, if you are a citizen of Mexico, you abide by Mexican law. If you are a Mexican citizen, you are likely also to be Catholic. Thus, you obey a certain set of rules in addition to the geostate rules. If you decide you dislike the rules of Catholicism, you are free to switch to a different set of rules, or no rules at all, so long as you still obey geostate law. However, your obeisance to the local church is not a matter of legal obligation. If you break your vow not to play video games during lent, there may be some social comeuppance, but the church has no legal ability to forcefully coerce you to obey.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Similarly, an individual in a geostate may belong to many types of organizations. For example, if you are the leader of a Boy Scout troop, you are obligated to go to the woods, wear shorts, and sport a yellow neckerchief. However, these rules are not made binding with force. They are no more laws, and therefore no more anthrostatist, than the rule that if you don’t do your share of housework your spouse will make you aware of your deficiency.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It might also be argued that confederated systems (i.e., those in which internal states are granted a great amount of autonomy) are a sort of anthrostate. At this moment on 6/10/2013, I am sitting outside a library in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. I have no doubt that if I were to begin selling marijuana to passersby, I would quickly be arrested and jailed. If I were in Washington or Colorado, the use of the same substance would, within certain limits, cause me no trouble. In that sense, it could be argued that confederated systems offer something like a polystate. However, they are necessarily geostates because they cast their laws geographically. And, all of the states within a larger nation must obey a large set of federal laws, and must subordinate much of their ability to use force on citizens. To the extent that these internal states can use force, that force is circumscribed by the federal state.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It could also be argued that a polystate of anthrostates is not different in a meaningful way from a minarchic<a href="#calibre_link-44">(4)</a> or anarchic <a href="#calibre_link-45">(5)</a> geostate. However, in both philosophical and practical terms, it would be quite different. For example, a minarchic geostate would still claim national boundaries. If a fascistic geostate were to invade a minarchy, the minarchy would find itself in a state of war. In a polystate, the fascist and minarchist anthrostates inside it would be coextensive, and the very idea of “invasion” would be nonsensical.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">To give another example &mdash; in a geostate of minimal laws, suppose Alice picks the pocket of Betsy. In a minarchy with a public court system, Betsy may seek legal remedy. In a minarchy with no public court system, we may suppose Alice would have to use private means to achieve arbitration. On the other hand, in a polystate, the picked pocket would be an issue between Alice’s and Betsy’s states that would have to be mutually arbitrated. If they were under the same anthrostate, anthrostate law (or lack thereof) would abide. If they were under different anthrostates in a single polystate, legal action would have to proceed in a manner somewhat akin to what geostates do with international police matters.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It may be noted that international police matters are not highly developed, but it is conceivable this would change in a polystate. The bureaucratic issues will be discussed more later.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It might also be argued that a polystate is in some way a form of syndicalism<a href="#calibre_link-46">(6)</a>. However, anthrostates, being diverse entities, are not syndicates. Even if they were, many (if not most) would allow non-syndicalist behavior, such as money and private property.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Simply stated &mdash; although there are modern systems that approximate a polystate, there are fundamental ways in which they differ, which lead to the probability that the construction of polystate society would be different from geostate society.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph5"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-12"></a><span class="char-style-override10">Chapter 4: Why the Polystate Requires Modern and Future Technology</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><span class="char-style-override10"><br class="calibre1" /></span>Right now you can’t buy a paperback book in any size you like. It is orders of magnitude cheaper, both at the level of the printer and distributor, to give everyone the size of book. Companies that are being very generous (or, more likely, squeezing money from collectors) will sometimes print as many as a half-dozen varieties, but rarely more. If books in physical form persist into the future, it is possible this situation will change thanks to developments in robotics and manufacturing. As robotics and additive manufacturing develop, we can expect to see inexpensive ubiquitous customizability in all aspects of life, from simple products to the size and shape of our homes to the genetics of our children.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It is conceivable that governments could go much the same way. In the past and in the present, the idea of tailoring the experience of every individual to his taxes, healthcare laws, social services, and so on would be unthinkable. Government bureaucracy is large enough without having to provide this massive service. But suppose that in at some point, computer AI is good enough that “computer assistants” actually assist the user in a meaningful way? Suppose that more and more delivery of goods and services can be done on the spot by individuals, thanks to better technology. In this case, it is possible that government could be extremely tailored to the individual. This would open up the possibility of a polystate in the real world.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It seems to me the two great barriers to a polystate are distance and bureaucratic complexity.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Much of the solution to distance has already been achieved. With the creation of the Internet, you can instantly file your taxes whether you’re living at home, afloat on the ocean, or in space. One suspects the taxman would do a better job of locating you in space than the man with the check from Social Security, and yet the provision of services too has been greatly simplified in the age of the Internet. In the Victorian era, bicycles were spoken of as “annihilating distance.” People and data now travel quite a bit faster and, as noted earlier, have not yet reached theoretical maxima. Speed is the exchange rate between distance and time, and the exchange rate is getting more and more favorable.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The bureaucratic complexity problem is more profound and probably awaits more developments in technological areas of computing, printing, and rapid delivery of goods. Better AI and higher computer speeds would be needed for many things in a polystate. There are many examples of why this should be but let us consider one that is emblematic: If there are far more states, and those states are coextensive, legal arbitrations would be complex. In fact, the number of possible inter-anthrostate dealings rises exponentially with the addition of each new anthrostate. For a polystate to function efficiently, the legal complexity of inter-anthrostate arbitration would have to be extremely streamlined. Even mildly improved AI would greatly facilitate this. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Commerce too would be very complex, and for similar reasons. If people of various systems are commingled in an environment where many governments may have many forms of tariff or embargoes and such, it would be necessary to have a system by which to readily calculate transactions. A polystate would likely increase the complexity of business and legal transaction. In a world with only 200 or so geostates, most commerce is not interstate and even if it were, geometry tells us that the number of possible two-state transactions is given by n(n-1)/2.<a href="#calibre_link-47">(7)</a> Consider then the situation of 10,000 anthrostates!</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It may turn out that, for a variety of reasons, the interactions would be less complex in practice. I can imagine a few ways in which there might be a second term in the equation that would lower the total. For example, many systems could agree to common rules for a range of common legal matters. Much like many different devices can use the same charger, there could be some standardization between many legal systems. It’s even conceivable that there could be a taxonomy of anthrostate types so that although 1,000,000 interactions are possible, only 10 or 20 interaction types happen in practice. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Additionally, a polystate rule could be made simply to limit the number of states to a manageable amount. But, it seems likely that whatever rules were put in place, the result would be too burdensome to exist without a large bureaucracy or some sort of computational way to arbitrate these many interactions.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Advanced printing might also simplify bureaucracy. Consider a world in which medical diagnosis can be done by computer and in which drugs can be printed. These two technologies would make the provision of almost any state healthcare system very simple. If the materials of which the drugs are made could be transported rapidly, no human beings would be required at all. The citizenry would have only to decide how much money to invest in the healthcare system. This is, of course, science fiction. However, some or all of it may be available in the next 50 years, and the provision of major services at a distance would eliminate the need for an incredible amount of bureaucracy.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In his 1860 essay, “Panarchie,” which is the closest notion I’ve found to the polystate idea, Paul Emile de Puydt brings up some of the issues contained in this book. In his notion, people go to a local register and sign up for a type of government. Many of the major problems he cites could potentially be navigated with more modern computing technology. For example, he proposes that the existence of only 10-20 government options would make for difficulty. But, in my opinion, it is likely (and grows more likely as population increases) that although there might be 10-20 major governments, there would also be many different varieties with small variations. The history of religion is proof that the interpretation of seemingly small facts can be the difference between unity and schism.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It seems to me that what we have here is a problem of databasing technology and the meaning of locality. The first problem might be solved already. Locality has not yet become meaningless &mdash; indeed, in the age of the Internet, locality may have ironically become more important thanks to the extra information generated by dense population &mdash; but if the speed of travel were ever increased by an order of magnitude, this might change.  </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">I should probably take care and not say too much more on the topic of future technology. As the saying goes, “Predict the future? It’s hard enough predicting the past.” One need only look at any prognostication older than 50 years to see that predictions tend to only be right for the same reason that a thousand arrows shot will result in a few bullseyes.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">That said, I do think it tenable to state that technology will increase choice and abundance to the point where a polystate is an economic and clerical possibility. But, we probably aren’t there yet.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph5"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-13"></a><span class="char-style-override10">Chapter 5: Potential Benefits of a Polystate</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />Here, I will only attempt to lay out some obvious benefits to the idea of the polystate. As you read, you may find yourself noting that some of these benefits are double-edged (and that the other edge may have fire and poison on it), but I will attempt to address those problems later in the book.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The most obvious benefit to living in a system of anthrostates is the level of choice. If you are a child born in a geostate that is fascistic, you will grow up in fascism with no choice but to stay or take great risk to escape. This is the mere result of physical reality. Borders can be guarded, governments tend to have better weapons than civilians, and most people are not willing to engage in any behavior that carries even a small risk of death.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In a polystate of anthrostates, change of government would be available readily. If you were born into a fascist anthrostate and dislike the elements of that government, you would be free to leave once you reach an appropriate age.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It should be noted that the reverse of this scenario is also true, distasteful though it might seem at first glance. If you are born in a social democracy, but decide you would rather be the property of a charismatic law-giver, you would be free to join the hypothetical cult-fascism anthrostate. Perhaps you find your personality more suited to a radical form of government than the fairly narrow spectrum of governments available today.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Indeed, one of the benefits of free non-geographic choice is that geostate forms that have historically been problematic might prove possible as anthrostates. In many nominally Communist<a href="#calibre_link-48">(8)</a> geostates, collective farming has been imposed with the apparently inevitable result that those farms work less efficiently. It may be that the failure of collectivization has not got to do with the individual so much as the aggregate. If 95% of people work poorly in a collectivized environment, any random collectivized farm will perform poorly. But it may be the case that 5% of people would excel in such an environment. By allowing individuals free, available, inexpensive choice of government, generally unpopular forms of existence might prove to be benign or even beneficial to the unusual individuals who choose them.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">A related benefit might be to reduce internal bureaucratic complexity by creating homogenized groups. This would be at the expense of the creation of complex external bureaucracies, but it is worth noting. Consider a nation made entirely of clones of me compared to a nation made of random individuals.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Most people take it for granted that it would be undesirable to have a centralized government decide what sort of bread everyone gets. There are several reasons for this. One is that there would probably be a high bargaining cost (either in a bureaucracy or in a voting system) devoted to determining what bread would be allotted in what amount. Perhaps more importantly, a central board is likely to not know that I prefer sourdough to wheat. As Bertrand Russell wrote in The Proposed Roads to Freedom<a href="#calibre_link-49">(9)</a>, “On every matter that arises, [the people in the Official Caste] know far more than the general public about all the definite facts involved; the one thing they do not know is ‘where the shoe pinches.’ “ The central planning board poses two large costs &mdash; one at the level of bureaucracy and/or bargaining, and another at the level of the ill-served consumer.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">However, in the hypothetical state where everyone is a Zach Weinersmith clone, the shoe pinches in the same place on every foot. This reduces both the bargaining cost (due to easily achieved consensus) and the externality of painful footwear. This example is of course absurd, but one can easily imagine the spectrum. If people are highly assortative in their choice of government, internal costs of organization may be substantially reduced.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The second major benefit, which is the natural offspring of this free choice, is that citizens have a great deal of recourse against their government.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In America, it has become a cliche that, prior to the potential election of a president of a certain party, wealthy celebrities threaten to emigrate. Celebrities are not typically a good group to look to for data, but they are relevant here in that they presumably have the means to leave the country readily, much more so than the typical American. When the election happens, few leave. There are several reasons why this might be the case, but I suspect the main reason is that it’s difficult to leave one’s country, even if one has the means. In addition to bureaucratic inertia, one must leave behind a world of friends and relatives, of people with similar cultural heritage, and of people with the same accent and language(s).</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">One’s options for a nation to flee to are also limited in their diversity. The wealthiest countries (on a per capita basis) have many differences, but almost without exception they are representative governments with mixed economies. Thus, change of geostate does not necessarily imply a great change in experience of governance.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In a polystate, where change of anthrostate is available on a regular basis, leaving a country would be a simple affair. Therefore, punishing one’s leaders is a simple affair. Consequently, leaders of a government would have more need to please their constituents. In a geostate, once you are the prime minister of a nation of about 100,000,000 people, you are very likely to end your term as the prime minister of a nation of about 100,000,000 people. That is, your “customer” base cannot change significantly. This is true even under low-quality and generally disliked governance. For example, the population of North Korea has increased every year since the end of the Korean War. One suspects this is despite the fairly tepid immigration numbers. In fact, it may surprise the reader to learn that the ratio of North Koreans to South Koreans has actually increased over time. There are perfectly scrutable sociological reasons for this, which I will not go into here, but for our purposes the salient fact is that Kim Jong-un has more citizens in his country than his father had.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It is hard to imagine he would have this larger population if any of his citizens could have freely switched to any other government. Indeed, if the polystate system were in any way reflective (as it might well be) of the rise and fall of social networks, it is conceivable that an anthrostate might experience the loss of the majority of its citizens in a matter of years if it made enough serious missteps.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It could be argued that there may be a difference between good governance and governance which pleases one’s constituency. This is to some extent a normative or even aesthetic question. But, regardless of the philosophy of good government, there is an extent to which good governance must have to do with what voluntary citizens decide is good. If most of the people are happy most of the time, as time goes on we might consider the governance to be reasonably “good” regardless of philosophical considerations. If an anthrostate is run by corrupt buffoons, but its voluntary citizens are happy with their performance, what business is it to an outsider to critique? If citizens are given free choice of government and ready ability to switch, it is likely that the various available governments will conform to the wants of the people. A counterargument might be “What if most of the people like the government, but the government is racist?” That is fair enough, but at least in an anthrostate, those who do not support racism in government could leave the racists to their own devices. Whether this would make the average human life better is a hard question to answer. The issue of distasteful governments is discussed in more depth later.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Another great benefit of the polystate would be the difficulty in warmaking. I conceive two reasons for this difficulty. The first problem would be the aforementioned availability of options. In democratic geostates, citizens rarely can stomach a war for more than a few years. However, wars can be maintained in the face of public opposition so long as the part of government that prosecutes wars does not have a change of opinions and/or occupants. If every war presented the possibility of a massive loss of citizenry, and therefore wealth and prestige, even a modern-day Napoleon would be reluctant to fight.<a href="#calibre_link-50">(10)</a></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">A less obvious reason for the difficulty of anthrostatic war would be the semi-random geographic distribution of citizens. In geostatic war, the nature of fighting is generally “this is my side and that’s your side, pal.” Polystates contain no recognized borders. Thus, in order to prosecute war, two factions in a polystate would either have to fight door-to-door, careful not to injure members of powerful third parties, or they would have to agree to combat at a certain place and time at a suitable location.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Clausewitz wrote that the goal of war was to disarm the enemy’s ability to make war. This is no doubt easier to accomplish against a centralized foe than a distributed one, as the modern experience of guerilla defense shows. If both attacker and defender are distributed, the difficulty grows larger still.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Perhaps more importantly, Oscar Wilde wrote “As long as war is regarded as wicked, it will always have its fascination. When it is looked upon as vulgar, it will cease to be popular.” That is to say, war has always been hell, but historically many pretty girls have been attracted to a man who just got back from hell. To the extent that war in a polystate would be more piecemeal, more absurd, more local to one’s own interest, and more likely to produce civilian casualties, war might be made more vulgar than ever.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">One last polystate benefit worth noting, though a bit speculative, is the ease of territorial expansion. If you were to look at an animation of nations of the world from the dawn of humanity, it would look like a few springs of parti-colored liquid, branching out and filling the world, forming a heterogenous mixture in perpetual swirl, which suddenly settles into a more or less rigid state right around 1945. Most modern people have greatly benefitted from the fact that territorial disputes, with a few small and frequently very stupid exceptions, have stopped. But, it may be the case that in the next few centuries, humanity sends colonists to other worlds. For any student of history, this may be a source of concern. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">A Moon Treaty was proposed in 1979, but has not been ratified by any nation with the ability to reach the moon. Currently, this is a non-issue. Suppose helium-3 becomes a valuable fuel &mdash; how many claimants then will assert mineral rights to the moon? The only likely resolution to conflicting claims between geostates would be military in nature &mdash; either through direct action or the threat of it.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In a polystate system, humanity would be more or less homogenized and therefore capable of a sort of amoebic expansion. Territorial claims would have to be settled at the level of individual property owners. Although this might still favor wealthy or technologically advanced anthrostates, anyone in another anthrostate would be able to join those societies. Although territorial expansion would not be a simple matter, it might be less likely to result in great wars.</p>

			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />Now that you’ve got the general idea (I hope), you may be wondering how it would work in particular. To that end, Book 2 will be a thought experiment in a hypothetical polystate.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">I am not a macroeconomist, so my ability to make speculative predictions about complex systems is limited. The notion of a polystate is in many practical aspects so different from historical systems that how it would work in practice is probably impossible to predict. So, here I wish only to attempt to find ways in which systems <span class="char-style-override11">could</span> work.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">To that end, the chapters that follow will each address a particular issue that may have general application. No section is definitive or exhaustive. Rather, it is my hope that individually they may serve as topics for thought and discussion, and as a whole they will help make the complexities of this thought experiment more visceral for the reader.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Anyone who has ever designed a rule for children knows that human beings do not behave the way the lawgiver would like them to behave &mdash; they behave pragmatically according to their values and incentives. Therefore, I have done my best to find ways in which pragmatic self-interested people would behave in this imaginary system. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph5"><br class="calibre1" /><span class="char-style-override10">Statement of Hypothetical Polystate:</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />The hypothetical polystate I am laying out will have a minimal set of rules. This is partially done for simplicity but also done because a more minimal polystate will more prominently display the differences between a polystate system and the geostate system. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It is conceivable that other systems could work. A polystate with no rules is possible, but perhaps problematic. Many polystates with lots of rules are also possible, but are less useful for the purpose of this book. I am not trying to design the best polystate or even a good polystate. I merely want to design a polystate that will serve as a good substrate for discussion.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">With that in mind, here are the rules for my polystate, which I will call WS-1, for Weinersmith 1. Each rule will be stated and then elaborated.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" /><span class="char-style-override11">1) No anthrostate may assert law as a geostate.</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />Rule one states simply that within the polystate, there can be no geostates. That is, no state can claim territory. This is important because it seems likely that if the assertion of geostate power were allowed, the most powerful anthrostates would claim land, and very quickly the world would be geostates.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" /><span class="char-style-override11">2) Individuals select their government once a year on their birthday.</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />Rule two is simply the protocol for change of government. The choice of one year intervals may beg for some explanation. Here it is:</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Conceivably, a more elegant polystate rule would be “Individuals select government any time.” The problem with that has to do with issues such as tax collection. There will be more on this later, but it merits brief discussion here. If a society wishes to collect, for example, income tax, any individual who wanted to avoid tax could simply switch systems. It is conceivable that multiple systems could ally to prevent this, but it’s also conceivable “tax haven” anthrostates would develop. This would still happen under the “one year” rule, but I believe that requiring polystate citizens to choose governments one year at a time would allow a number of measures that would mitigate the problem. Two years might be better, or 6 months might be better, and I fully recognize that 365 days is entirely arbitrary.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It might also be asked why the changeover is a year from birth, as opposed to January 1 for everyone. I believe overlapping changes of regime would be good for stability. Having everyone change government at the same second would be, in a very real sense, a global revolution. As I said before, it’s above my pay grade to determine the specific results of such a complex system, but it may be prudent to assume that anything of that magnitude in such a small time could be a source of danger and political intrigue. Randomly staggering the changeover time allows for the global revolution to be more fluid.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The possibility of coercive governments looms large here. This is also true for geostates, so an anthrostate isn’t necessarily worse. Additionally, the anthrostate might very well be better if there were powerful governments known to protect their new citizens. That is, suppose you were in a government that threatened you and your family, you could potentially declare all of the threatened people to be refugees of some other government. In that condition, the carrying out of the threat might pose an international danger to the coercive region.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">This could also provide a backdoor to constant switching. However, that too could be resolved at the inter-anthrostate level. If a refugee comes to your anthrostate for reasons of asylum, it’s a much different matter from a refugee coming for tax evasion.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" /><span class="char-style-override11">3) Any government violating rule 1 shall have its government status revoked. Its members will have 24 hours to decide a new government.</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />This rule simply deals with the punishment for behaving like a geostate. Rule 3 serves two purposes: (1) It creates a simple system for reassignment. (2) It hopefully makes the idea of forming a geostate taboo and distasteful in the long run.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The question as to how rule three could be enforced is a hard one. If it were a cultural norm that geostate formation were taboo, there would be no need for additional law. However, if that were not the case, there would have to be some additional law for use of force against the violators.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It may seem like a stretch to assume that geostate formation would become a taboo. However, in a purely polystate environment, the formation of a geostate would pose a substantial economic loss to all other members. It’d be something akin to a single nation claiming the entirety of the moon today. In addition, it is entirely possible that in a significantly Heterogeneous polystate, the claimed geostate would violate the private property rights of many individuals. So, it is not inconceivable that geostate formation would be considered unjust.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph6"><br class="calibre1" />* * *</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />These are the only rules for the WS-1 anthrostates. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">I have some concern that the minimal nature of the above rules will be seen as a sort of backdoor to minarchy. It is decidedly not. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">A polystate is not simply a minimal state built on free association. In all states, geo or anthro, the power of force and coercion is vested in some authority. This is generally the defining difference between a free association and state authority. Your local chess club may demand you pay monthly dues, but they cannot compel that payment without invoking some state authority. Even a free association with the implements of force (e.g., guns, explosives, etc.) cannot use that force on fellow citizens without the authority of the geostate.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In WS-1, power of force would be distributed among many overlapping groups. That is, unlike the free associations inside a minarchy, in the polystate each free association would be granted the power of force to use as it sees fit. This is the essence (and perhaps the paradox) of the polystate &mdash; coercive free association. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In the polystate, power of coercion would be distributed, but it would not be absent. It is in fact conceivable that within a real polystate, the aggregate individual<a href="#calibre_link-52">(1)</a> would experience less freedom than the aggregate individual in a system of geostates. It seems to me probable that in a polystate, the selection of anthrostates would follow a sort of bell curve of population on the axis between minarchy and monarchy.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Now then with all that in mind, I will try to suggest how WS-1 might work in a number of circumstances. Before you dive in, let me offer this disclaimer: Government necessarily touches on just about every aspect of life. Some people may find the bare mention of several topics to follow to be offensive. I can’t ask for you not to be affronted, but I do request that you go into the following discussions with an open mind; my goal here is in some sense to undermine many assumptions of political order, and so necessarily I will have to violate a few taboos. Unless explicitly stated, nothing below is meant to endorse any particular system of ethics, justice, or governance.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph5"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-16"></a><span class="char-style-override10">Chapter 2: Crime and Punishment</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />First, let’s deal with the problem of crime. Several potential hurdles for the polystate present themselves &mdash; (1) the bureaucracy needed for these many overlapping systems, (2) different understandings as to what constitutes crime (3) crimes having to do with self-expression, such as public indecency, pornography, forbidden information, etc.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The bureaucracy issue has been and will be discussed in the context of several other issues, so I don’t wish to belabor it too much here. It seems to me that this issue is in essence similar to the issues of international law among geostates, only it is likely to present itself more often. In addition, whereas modern international law is sometimes made arbitrary by the exigencies of powerful nations, “international” law among anthrostates would have to be enforced at least with as much justness as a typical geostate. In other words, some system of rapid and generally agreeable arbitration would be necessary.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">This would be especially important for petty crimes. For most Western states, murder trials are already quite complicated, as befits their gravity. No doubt the same would be true within a polystate. That is, if inter-anthrostate murder trials were drawn-out affairs, they would at least be no worse than the current state of things. However, the case of smaller crimes, such as graffiti for example, could be problematic. If, in an ideal system, the care of due process scales with severity of crime, petty crime should be arbitrated quickly. Petty crime between whole nations could pose a problem. Now and then, in the modern geostate system, an American will commit a small crime in Singapore, such as spitting out gum on a sidewalk. To an American, this is at worst poor taste, but is certainly not a crime. In Singapore, the crime is worthy of corporal punishment. Because of the disparity, an action whose resolution is swift in either country (for better or worse) becomes a matter of great discussion.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">For a functioning polystate, this could not be the case. It seems to me there would be several possible solutions to this problem. One possibility would be that the larger anthrostates either make their criminal codes similar to one another or come to some agreement about the most common occurrences. The main problem here is that it would create an onerous burden on smaller states for all small criminal proceedings. Another possibility would be the creation of some kind of non-national court system with the express purpose of squaring the laws of various anthrostates with one another.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Getting to the issue of different sets of laws, it is unfortunately inevitable that various groups understand the notion of justice in various ways. Indeed, in a polystate, some might recognize no such thing as justice. It may be an unavoidable flaw in the idea of WS-1 that it cannot deal readily with legal matters between nations with very different legal frameworks. If one society has a constitution and another has a capricious dictator, no modern Solomon would be able to create justice between two parties. In general, if one society uses legal precedence as a guide, while another uses the whims of an autocrat, there is little hope that law is predictable for the citizens in either society. It may be that a more realistic polystate would have to have some sort of higher judiciary built in.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The one possible defense I can think of is this: Suppose we consider the worst possible scenario &mdash; a democracy overlaps with a group of insane fascists. The dictator of the fascists tells his people that if they attack the democrats, they will face no punishment from him, and he will defend them in arbitration. It seems to me that the only resolution to this sort of thing is some sort of war between anthrostates. And, whereas it is likely that liberal democracies will be larger and more affluent, those nations will likely win. Thus, over time, justice (in the sense of equal application of law for the citizens of a state) should prevail. This does not obviate the possibility of something like a Nazi government, in which a modern, large, technologically advanced nation is also a fascist dictatorship. However, it is not clear that a polystate would handle this situation worse than geostates do now. In addition, the difficulty of maintaining consensus over a long war is high. There will be more on this in the chapter on war.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Crimes having to do with self-expression would also present difficulty. A geostate for nudists is not a problem for either the nudists within or the non-nudists without. A nudist anthrostate may well be a problem for the Muslim theocracy next door. This too would be difficult to resolve. There are several similar issues which may carry greater gravity than seeing a naked lady walking down the street &mdash; public consensual violence, public display of censored information, public drug use, and so forth. It is conceivable some of these issues could be ameliorated by the use of private property law, but this presents its own problems, to be discussed later.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">There may not be a perfect resolution to this issue at the moment. However, as I mentioned earlier, a polystate cannot function in practice without technology. Crimes of self-expression may be resolvable through some technological system not yet available. For example, suppose system A forbids men to see naked women, while system B forbids its members to wear clothes. Conceivably, in a technologically advanced polystate, the onus of sheltering one’s eyes could be put on system A. For example, the system A people could have an advanced software-based set of blinders that would obscure the offending body parts. As I am not a theologian, I can’t speak to the ethical difference between real and virtual niqab. But, it does seem to me that if the eyes of the viewer and the free expression of the viewee can be protected, in principle the problem can be resolved. I would have some concern over the idea of entire generations raised without the ability to see offensive material, but that is a problem of the strange intersection of ethics and technology in any system, polystate, geostate, or otherwise.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph6"><br class="calibre1" />* * *</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph5"><br class="calibre1" />As noted above, the resolution of crime may be problematic, at least in my fairly minimal polystate conception. That said, if it could be worked out, there might be great benefits. In a system where each individual selects a government, rates of violence might be lower. To give just one example, in the USA, drug offenders are significantly more likely than other criminals to have committed their crimes in pursuit of money. That is, there is a large number of crimes that are not committed for passion or otherwise in a state of madness. In a polystate system, it is very likely that there would be anthrostates that allow free markets for drugs that are illegal in other anthrostates. This would both lower the price of illegal drugs (mitigating the need for violent crime in anthrostates that disallow usage) and provide frameworks that cater to the needs and desires of their users.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It might then be noted that in a polystate, prohibition is essentially impossible without draconian enforcement laws and panoptic surveillance. That is, even if your anthrostate disallows marijuana, your neighbor who lives in the Rastafarian anthrostate has got you covered in case of emergency. I can only say in defense of the difficulty of prohibition of substances and information that it seems to me to be a feature and not a flaw of the system. Those citizens who wish not to be exposed to such information are at liberty to do their best to avoid it.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph5"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-17"></a><span class="char-style-override10">Chapter 3: Children in a Polystate</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />It seems to me that there are two major questions regarding children within a polystate. The first is what government a child exists under, and the second is whether an anthrostate can have laws regarding children that are anathema to members of other anthrostates.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Although the laws of WS-1 do not explicitly deal with children, it is likely that every anthrostate would have rules regarding children. Suppose Marie is a member of a social democracy. She has just given birth to a daughter, Irene. Her anthrostate has rules that say what she can do to that child and what she cannot do. Those rules state the child’s age of consent, and the procedure for that child’s emancipation. As these conditions are built-in aspects of human life (perhaps even animal life), it is likely that all anthrostates would have provisions regarding them. To the extent that they will differ, they are no different than geostates. Where an anthrostate has problems (e.g., age of consent’s arbitrariness), so too does a geostate have problems. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Let’s start with custody issues. To get at the general idea, I will start with a simple and therefore somewhat absurd example. It might be asked, “What if another state lays claim to my child?” That is, what if there is some state of madmen who declare a law that “All children born belong to us.” Let’s call this state Kidnappocracy. Assuming the unlikely notion that Kidnappocracy is able to attract membership, the result would be a competing claim between the parents of the child and the Kidnappocrats. I think it can be fairly said that this is also similar to the condition of geostates. That is, in the modern world, suppose there was a geostate called Kidnapistan. Kidnapistan may claim rights to my child. However, I and the force of my government would back my claim to the child and not recognize the need for arbitration in the matter. Additionally, should Kidnapistan attempt to take my child, my government would respond with force to protect its citizens.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It is likely then that the major difference would be that in a geostate system, Kidnapistan would be blocked by a border, whereas in a polystate the Kidnappocrats would be overlapping with everyone else. I think it can reasonably be supposed that communities would make effort to keep out Kidnappocrats either by the use of trespassing law, embargo of sales to Kidnappocrats, or even declaration of war.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The above situation is purposefully somewhat absurd. The point I wish to make is that a dispute over claims of a child would be a matter between governments, arbitrated in much the same way as such claims are made now. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">We can also consider a less extreme but more complex case &mdash; competing claims to custody between typical anthrostates. For example, suppose one person belongs to a Catholic theocracy in which divorce is illegal, and another belongs to a secular government in which divorce is allowed. Custody arbitration would be doubly complex because beyond the normal questions regarding divorce, at the end of the proceeding, one government would recognize the divorce and one would not! We can imagine similar situations for a system of patrilineal claim disputing against a system of matrilineal claim.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Complexity aside, I suspect this too is more or less the same as the geostate system. It is already the case that divorce procedure can be arbitrated between dual citizens. A polystate system would be no different, except that it would probably have more intra-government cases to deal with. That said, one suspects that in a polystate there would be an onus on parents to agree on a system together, or at the very least to select an anthrostate for the child. That is, noting that divorce and custody would be complex in a polystate is merely to note that divorce and custody questions would exist in a polystate. There is an extent to which it might be far more complex in the polystate. However, this may only seem to be the case because of its rarity. It is conceivable that in a polystate system, the marriage rules could be worked out in greater detail and rigor than they are today.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The second question I raised was about the level of control over one’s child. Suppose, for example, one anthrostate sets age of consent at 14, and another sets age of consent at 18. Then, suppose a member of each group has sex with the other, and that each member is at the age of consent of the other government.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">That is, suppose an 18-year-old from a government with 14 as age of consent has sex with a 14-year-old from a government that sets age of consent at 18. The result is that the 18-year-old has not violated his/her own anthrostate’s law, but HAS violated law in the other anthrostate. Likewise, the 14-year-old has violated his/her own anthrostate’s law, but HAS NOT violated the other anthrostate. To understand how this mess might unravel, let us consider the equivalent geostate cases.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In one case, we can imagine an 18-year-old American female (age of consent 18) goes to Papua New Guinea (age of male consent, 14) and has sex with the 14-year-old boy. In that case, distasteful though it may be, neither the American nor the New Guinean has violated the law of the land in which the act was committed.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In the second case, we can imagine a 14-year-old New Guinean goes to America and has sex with an 18-year-old female. In that case, equally distasteful, the American has violated law and is at risk of punishment. The 14-year-old would be a victim in America and would of course receive no punishment of a legal nature.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The polystate would be similar, with important differences. In order to understand them, we must understand the purposes of consent law. It seems to me that the main purpose of consent law is to protect those who are considered unable to offer consent. That is, to state the obvious, consent laws do not exist to protect 40-year-olds from 14-year-olds.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Therefore, we can say that in our two hypothetical anthrostates, no person considered by his government to require protection would have gone unprotected. In that sense, one could argue that no wrong was committed, at least from a legal perspective. Again, it may seem distasteful to an American reader, but the alternative view is that consent is constantly violated in Papua New Guinea. The reader may well consider this true, but I suspect the reader does not believe that the United States would be, for example, within its rights to invade another country in order to increase the age of consent.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In addition, it should perhaps be considered that there is a difference between individuals raised in societies with different ages of consent. Presumably, age of consent is selected to reflect biological fact. But the opposite may in some way be at work. In the United States, the age of 18 is fetishized, even though it has no biological meaning. But for an arbitrary choice, the age vested with so much sexual intrigue could have been 17 or 24 or 19.25. Within reason, the age selected by society may in some way determine the preparedness of the individual to give consent at that age.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It might be elucidatory to consider a system with no age basis at all. Imagine a technocratic society in which individuals are given psychological exams to determine their ability to give consent. This framework would put forward some situations which almost all modern people would find abhorrent: (a) a very young individual being able to consent to sex, and (b) an older individual of sound mind being unable to give consent.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Once again, it’s worth first considering how things would play out in a similar situation in  geostates. In modern-day Yemen, age of consent is determined by puberty<a href="#calibre_link-53">(2)</a>. On this basis, it is conceivable that a child as young as nine could be considered to be capable of consent. Although I suspect every single Westerner reading this finds the idea repulsive, they may not find it to be grounds for legal or military action against Yemen. In fact, in all likelihood, I suspect few readers were aware. More importantly, they probably would not demand imprisonment or death for a Westerner who becomes a Yemeni citizen and makes use of those consent laws. Although that Westerner would likely be shunned by society, and perhaps even banned from return, the fact that such is possible has apparently not stopped the largely peaceful coexistence of Yemen and the rest of the world.<a href="#calibre_link-54">(3)</a> In fact, the major Yemeni conflicts since unification in 1990 have been internal ones.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">That said, we can consider instances where differences might lead to conflict. It may in fact be a virtue of the polystate that it makes repugnant behavior more local and therefore subject to scrutiny.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Let us suppose that government A finds the consent laws of government B so revolting that they cannot stand idly by. In that case, it is likely that government A would either take military action against government B, or simply seize the children of government B by force. What would be the result of this?</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">I suspect that if government B were engaging in repugnant practices, it would have few allies in its struggle. If it were engaging in more or less agreeable practices, it would have many allies in its struggle. It is of course possible that a good government should be beaten by a wicked government, but this would hardly be a problem unique to the polystate.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Indeed, it should be noted that the historical tendency of humanity has been to increase age of consent over time. In order for us to declare a polystate system equivalent or superior to a geostate system, we must only find the polystate no worse than the system of geostates. It may well be the case that in the polystate, age of consent would have risen faster, since the commingling of many people could produce a general progression toward the mean. A judgmental neighbor may well have a more profound effect than a judgmental foreign government.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Thus, by and large, the case of anthro and geostates would be similar, and the anthrostates would have the arguable benefit of more locally confronting citizens with the behavior of others. If there is an ideal age of consent (or system for consent determination), it could spread more rapidly in a polystate. If there is no ideal age of consent, and in fact age of consent is more a matter of local culture, the polystate would allow for more individual choice. That said, the overlapping of these legal systems might result in more conflict, especially when anthrostates are first established.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The major inferiority of anthrostates here would be to make arbitration more complicated. It is likely that a polystate system would result in more interstate legal matters. This is discussed in more detail in other chapters.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph5"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-18"></a><span class="char-style-override10">Chapter 4: Commerce</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />Commerce, like legal arbitration, would likely pose difficulty for a polystate for similar reasons. It seems to me that there are two major areas that would pose the greatest potential difficulty &mdash; the running of businesses and the use of currency.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Suppose there exists a business called Bob’s Bakery. Bob’s Bakery wishes to have three employees. As Bob is looking through applicants, he finds three good ones. Two (A and B) are from minarchic governments, and the third ( C ) is from a highly socialized government. A and B are willing to work for 5 dollars an hour. C’s government refuses to allow its people to work for less than 10 dollars an hour. Does this pose a dilemma?</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It seems to me that it shouldn’t. There are a number of ways situations like this could be resolved, and given the nature of the polystate, it is likely that many different techniques would be employed. Let’s consider a few.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">One possible solution would be for Bob to simply employ all three. Although this might pose a problem for the morale of A and B, there would certainly be no legal difficulty. The morale question would have to do with the nature of governments. For example, suppose A’s government tops off her wage to $15 so long as she’s working. She might not care what Bob pays.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Another solution would be for C’s government (the highly socialized one) to insist only that employers in its system pay a certain minimum wage. That is, workers are not obligated to demand a certain wage for their labor. That would free (or oblige, depending on your perspective) the citizens of C’s government to take lower-wage jobs. This might well pose a social dilemma by putting a “race to the bottom” on wages. In other words, it might well be the case that the lowest possible wage would effectively be set by those anthrostates which have no minimum wage. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In fact, the situation could conceivably be even more dire. Suppose there existed a fascistic state, whose leader insists that his workers only ever charge $1 an hour for labor. By this means, the powerful fascist might keep his citizens in check, undercut other economies, and still accrue some wealth. This is possible, but it must be hoped that in a voluntary state, very few people would be willing to live in this condition. In the first place, it would be degrading to the desire for autonomy most humans possess. In the second, pragmatically there could perhaps even be competition among fascisms. That is, <span class="char-style-override11">your fascism</span> forces you to work for the Dear Leader at a rate of $1/hour, while <span class="char-style-override11">my fascism</span> forces me to work for The Fuhrer at $1.50/hour plus medical. So, conceivably there would not be so much a race to the bottom as a race to equilibrium. Indeed, there are many current geostates or states in confederated geostates which lack minimum wage, but which nevertheless have workers who are, on average, paid as well as in comparable states. And, in those states which do have minimum wage, it is rarely more than a small percentage of working people who earn only that much.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In addition, more socialized systems may produce higher-quality employees than non-socialized systems. That is, if the government of C expends a great deal of its citizens’ money on its citizens’ education and health, for example, and those expenditures result in an economically higher-quality citizen, it is to be expected that Bob’s Bakery should <span class="char-style-override11">want</span> to pay C more money than A or B. C may very well have more training or aptitude by virtue of the superiority of his system. Thus, it may even be the case that, rather than a race to the bottom or a race to equilibrium, there would be many races to many equilibria.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Let us consider a more extreme case that may generate complexity. Suppose there exists a store called Karl’s Knishes. Karl is a member of a communal government that does not recognize private property. He is thus only the manager of the business, not the owner. Into that store walks Adam, who as it happens is a member of a government whose economy is laissez-faire capitalist. Karl’s government expressly forbids selling of goods to Adam’s government. This presents two problems for Karl &mdash; first, he must verify the governments of all buyers before he can sell; second, he may be seriously limited in his selection of buyers.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The selection problem is a problem for the business alone, so it is not of interest. The issue of determining the anthrostatic origin of all customers is a bit harder. But, I don’t believe it would be any harder than many issues that are already easily handled in modern geostates. For example, if I wish to buy a new computer, I will be obligated to provide some form of identification, unless I pay in cash. Short of getting a large wad of bills and going to a computer store with a sack of cash, I have to show information about my state of origin. So, the ID problem would pose no new issues for what I assume would be the typical anthrostate.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Admittedly, this could be problematic for ultra-minarchic systems. Suppose, for example, in WS-1 60% of governments require sellers to identify buyers’ governments before selling. This would put a great onus on minimal systems to yet still have some form of identification, even though it goes against their principles. In other words, no anthrostate is necessarily an island, and the capacity to have one’s own anthrostate have a very high degree of autonomy might exist in tension with the capacity for someone else’s anthrostate to provide a strong central government. How this would play out in reality is hard to predict. However, it should be noted that even a system of minimal government could still avail itself of internal or external third-party verification services. Indeed, political libertarians often note the capacity of non-governmental organizations to take the place of regulatory systems. Much like the hypothetical socialized government earlier, a minarchist system in a polystate would be obligated to put its framework where its mouth is, so to speak.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Thus, it seems to me that the major issues for inter-anthrostate commerce would be the management of legal codes and the potential for the laws (or lack thereof) of one anthrostate to bind the laws (or lack thereof) of another anthrostate. The former issue could potentially be aided by technology, much of which already exists. The latter would be a fact of the matter in the system, hopefully mitigated in some ways suggested in this book. In addition, it is not clear that the issue of interplay between governments would be completely different from that of a confederated geostate. There are locations in the United States where by standing just so, one half of your body will be worthy of $6.25/hour while the other will be worthy of $7.00/hour. This, like many things political, is technically absurd but pragmatically unfraught. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The existence of separate governments for humans necessarily results in some absurdities. We are not individually so different as the different governments we have tried. But, it is not clear that these absurdities are always a problem, nor is it clear that a polystate will produce more of them than a collection of geostates.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The matter of the use of currency is, I think, a much simpler problem to resolve. It is merely a matter of technology and infrastructure, in essence the same as the aforementioned problem of bureaucracy. In the unlikely event that each of 10,000 anthrostates decided to have its own currency, all transactions could be handled through a simple currency market, with the arguable downside that physical money would probably be extremely cumbersome for consumers and businesses.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">This sort of general currency market might well have some benefits. For example, hyperinflation is a notoriously hard phenomenon to stop once it begins. In a system of overlapping states, it might be much easier to simply jump ship to a stable currency. Provided that the hyperinflation isn’t systemic, this would be of great use to small anthrostates. In addition, individuals could choose various anthrostates based on their macroeconomic views. This may be a good end unto itself, but it also means that there could be more experimentation to see what works well in monetary and fiscal policy.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In reality, I suspect in a polystate there would be a rapid convergence on a small number of reserve currencies that would be used for simplicity and perceived stability. It’s even possible that currencies used by many states could acquire a sort of independence from their anthrostate of origin. This would provide the added benefit of stability in a system where government sizes might regularly change. In the modern world, the dollar is the reserve currency because people perceive the US as very stable. If every system were somewhat unstable<a href="#calibre_link-55">(4)</a>, it would be useful to have the dollar still available after a system schisms.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It might be suggested that the need for currency per se imposes limits on the forms of anthrostate available. Suppose a group wishes to live in a society that doesn’t use money at all. I will admit, outside of a universe in which energy is essentially free, it is hard for me to imagine a truly money-free society. At the very least, nominally moneyless societies still engage in barter and social exchange. However, supposing it is possible, I think we must first note that a potential moneyless anthrostate wouldn’t be in a substantially different position from a potential moneyless geostate. A money-free geostate would only be able to acquire trade goods through barter. Just so, members of money-free anthrostates would be obliged to use resources rather than cash if they wished to trade with other anthrostates. It is likely that a moneyless anthrostate citizen would be surrounded by money-using citizens, and this fact might be said to constrain one’s ability to truly exist in a moneyless society. The status of that citizen is not really different from the status of any geostate that tries its hand at moneylessness. So, if there are constraints to moneylessness, they aren’t limited to the polystate framework.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Additionally, it is conceivable that with a more complex market system, barter could simply be rolled into transactions such that it becomes indistinguishable from money. Though this might be difficult at the individual level (“Ma’am, how many bushels of corn would it cost for 3 cappuccinos?”), it might work perfectly well at the level of society. Many proposed moneyless societies sensibly make property communal. For example, some flavors of anarcho-syndicalism propose that trade syndicates determine how much of their goods go to the people in society. We can imagine a collectivized farming anthrostate might exchange corn for metal, then distribute it accordingly. So, although barter might be inefficient at the level of individual purchases, moneyless anthrostates could get around this by bartering at the level of anthrostates and then distributing to citizens.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph5"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-19"></a><span class="char-style-override10">Chapter 5: Co-Existence with Geostates</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />Could a polystate co-exist alongside a geostate? In principle, it’s clear that this is possible. In practice, there might be some complications. For example, what is the status of a traveler from a geostate into an anthrostate? Is immigration possible? What about illegal immigration? How would polystate-geostate war work? Unlike a geostate, a polystate cannot on principle have a standing army or border guards. But, by virtue of its many anthrostates, it may in fact have many standing armies and many border guards.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The number of particular possibilities for this kind of interaction is too large to go through thoroughly. So, I want to consider a few particular cases that should give the reader a sense of how geostate-polystate interactions might occur.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">First, let us look at the status of a traveler from geo to anthro. The geostater would be something like a person today traveling abroad, with the exception that he would not abide by the rules of two countries. Other than the minimal rules of WS-1, the traveler would be abiding only by the laws of his geostate. That is to say, assuming she was not in violation of the three laws of the polystate, she would be more or less the same as a member of an anthrostate modeled on and connected to her home geostate.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">I do not see why this would pose a problem. The polystate is already the overlapping of many governments. The addition of a geostate government to the mix wouldn’t necessarily pose a problem. One interesting result would be that the border between polystate and geostate would be more like a diode than an insulator. Whereas a geostater might readily enter the polystate, the reverse would not necessarily be true. In addition, the geostater will maintain her own laws in the polystate, while the polystater would become like a geostater abroad in a foreign geostate.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It might be asked what would happen in the case of an international incident. For example, suppose a citizen of hypothetical geostate Bombsylvania enters WS-1 and detonates a bomb inside a city. Many WS-1 members are killed as a result. Suppose for now that the bomber is a citizen of Bombsylvania, but not a state actor. That is, he is a terrorist.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">What must be and what would be the response of WS-1? I believe that WS-1 per se would not have a response, as its own rules do not permit this. However, when the bomb went off, it took away blood and treasure from individual anthrostates. Therefore, those anthrostates &mdash; if it is in their interest &mdash; would likely seek redress from the state of Bombsylvania. Anthrostates, much like individual people, could act separately or as a group. I think it is likely that both situations would arise. That is, the hypothetical international incident would not be terribly different from the result of a bomber attacking a crowded metropolitan city, which is likely to contain tourists from many geostates.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In fact, it could well be the case that such events would be more unlikely in a polystate. Acts of terror, even by insane people, are politically motivated. If you are a terrorist wishing to make a violent political statement, it might be much easier against a geostate. After all, a bomb in a geostate probably kills and terrorizes only the members of that state. A bomb in a polystate may kill and terrorize the members of many different groups, neutralizing or even going counter to the intended political result. The more random and overlapping the anthrostates, the more difficult precision bomb strikes would become.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">If it turns out that ideologies tend to be reflected geographically, even in the absence of formal geostates, it would mitigate the anti-terror value of overlapping governments. It is not clear how geography and ideology would turn out in a polystate, especially if we are talking about a world of extreme rapid transit. However, it’s worth noting that in the modern geostate world, cities are the typical targets of terrorists. Cities are also where the most diversity (in terms of ethnicity, place of birth, religion, etc.) is found. So, it’s possible the best terrorist targets (in terms of population) would be the worst terrorist targets (in terms of heterogeneity of anthrostates).</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">If our hypothetical terrorists were opposed to polystates per se, having a variety of anthrostates would afford no protection.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Let us suppose now that the bomber was in fact a paid state actor. That is, a member of Bombsylvania was employed by his state to blow up a WS-1 city. Would the polystate be in exceptional danger by virtue of its complexity?</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Very possibly. Perhaps a more direct question would be whether coalition armies perform better or worse in the prosecution of war. What would likely happen in a polystate under attack is that many of the anthrostates would be compelled onto a war footing. In a sense, it could be said that the response would be akin to the response of the US and EU in the case of China invading Europe. A host of treaties would come into effect as the nations of the West organized for war. Large economically powerful geostates would take the lead in the organization and prosecution of the war, with smaller states less obligated. That is to say, it seems possible that the response of the polystate would be more or less the same as the response of a geostate alliance to the attack of one of its members.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">That said, I suspect that all things being equal (population, wealth, technology, etc.), you’d be better off placing your wager on a geostate victory. Combined allied forces probably do not function as well as forces of a single large state. If you could ask Generals Montgomery and Patton if the overall prosecution of World War II was made more efficient by the existence of his counterpart, you would at least find them to be in agreement on the answer. In addition, the required level of organization within a polystate coalition would probably be higher due to the great number of anthrostates, possibly with great variation in command structure. This might well simply waste resources in a way a geostate would not. Politics and war are not happy bedfellows. Friendly fire within an army is tragic; friendly fire between allies is an incident.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">With this in mind, a polystate’s best hope might be to have all things NOT be equal. It is a matter of historical fact that different governments produce different results in terms of wealth, human capital, and technology. It is not always the most militarized (in terms of percent GDP spent on war) or most organized society that has the most money or the best machinery. In due time, the variety of the polystates might economically and technologically make up for the organizational problems it poses. Whether this is the case is too complex to determine without experiment.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Let’s consider a different incitement to war &mdash; territorial dispute. Suppose a geostate claims a corner of WS-1. As WS-1 does not claim any territory, and by definition its anthrostates cannot claim territory, how could the members of the polystate respond?</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Much like the bombing hypothetical, although the action of territorial claim does not affect the territory of any nation (since no anthrostate claims any geography), it does affect the private property of individuals<a href="#calibre_link-56">(5)</a> who are members of anthrostates. On this basis, the response would be much the same as the bombing situation.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Let us consider one more case of interest &mdash; illegal immigration. One of the interesting results of a polystate is that illegal immigration is not really possible. An individual within the territory of the polystate would have only to find an anthrostate to accept him. Having accomplished this, he would be allowed to switch to any other system at the appropriate time. Potential issues arising once membership is attained will be explored later. But, whereas the polystate doesn’t have a border so much as a diode, the idea of an illegal border crossing is moot. In addition, some of the concerns having to do with illegal immigration (cost, culture, etc.) might be ameliorated by the nature of the polystate.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In the case of cost, only those nations wishing to bear the cost they perceive of immigration would be willing to accept the immigrant. Thus, for example, no individual would be made to unwillingly pay for the healthcare of an immigrant.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Concerns of culture or race issues<a href="#calibre_link-57">(6)</a> could also be helped by the polystate. Consider for example an influx of redheads from a neighboring geostate. There might well be WS-1 anthrostate members who don’t wish their race corrupted by the pernicious blood of a thousand gingers. Although by WS-1 law, these anti-redhead states could not ban red-haired members from claiming membership, they could make life for redheads unbearable enough that none would wish to join. That is, those anthrostates wishing to maintain some self-perception of cultural or racial homogeneity would be able to do so. It is my suspicion that they would do so to the detriment of their ability to maintain high or high-quality citizenship, but nevertheless those people would perhaps be pacified.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">A trickier issue would be the nature of border surveillance. One of the major modern concerns over “open borders” is whether terrorists can easily enter the country. Whether this is a real or imagined issue<a href="#calibre_link-58">(7)</a> is beside the point. Does the polystate prevent the policing of borders? Not necessarily. Although polystate citizens can’t really restrict the movement of people, it is conceivable that certain anthrostates might form alliances to monitor people who enter the polystate from other geostates. If those entering claim no geostate origin or anthrostate selection, they would not have a legal right to not be surveilled. If they are geostate citizens, the nature of the geostate might determine what sort of surveillance they are subjected to. If they join an anthrostate, they are subject to the laws of that anthrostate, which has a vested interest in protecting itself from terrorism and from international incidents involving its citizens. Thus, although the polystate might not have the ability to police its borders as heavily as a geostate, such caution is by no means prohibited.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Although geostate-polystate interactions would be odd, they would not be unimaginably so. Many instances of geostate-polystate interactions would be akin to, if not identical to, interactions between a geostate and an alliance of other geostates. The case of immigrants to a polystate as opposed to a geostate would be somewhat different, but it is not clear whether on the whole the difference is good or bad.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph5"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" /><span class="char-style-override10"><a id="calibre_link-20"></a>Chapter 6: Discriminatory Systems</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />For the purpose of this chapter, by “discriminatory systems” I mean essentially this: anthrostates which either disallow certain members for distasteful<a href="#calibre_link-59">(8)</a> reasons (gender, race, orientation, etc.) or systems which create internal citizenship classes for distasteful reasons.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It is a fact that in a polystate such ugly systems would exist. However, I do not think the existence of ugliness makes the overall system bad any more than the existence of Hustler magazine makes freedom of the press bad. Any time freedom is allowed it will be abused. This is not a flaw in freedom (else police states might be more desirable) but a flaw in humanity.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It must always be borne in mind that the polystate is at its core voluntary. This fact makes for very different results for oppressed individuals. Thus, situations that seem at first to be horrible, may be less so. This is a rather taboo topic, but I believe it really poses no problem for a polystate beyond those problems that exist in all geostates. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">So, to start off, I want to give several scenarios and how they might not be so bad as they first seem.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">As discussed earlier, one of the problems of geostates is that they are sticky. It is hard, for reasons financial, cultural, emotional, perhaps even metaphysical, to leave one’s homeland. It is also at times illegal to leave one nation or illegal to enter another. And, all that is assuming there is a friendly nation nearby. In a polystate, the situation is much less dire. If you find yourself a redhead in an anthrostate suddenly overtaken by an anti-ginger faction, at most you will have to wait one year to switch. Presumably, in this situation, there would be anthrostates that would provide sanctuary in the interim.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It is conceivable that if a system changed rapidly enough, our oppressed redheads might find themselves in a more dire situation. But, at the very least, this seems no worse than it is with geostates, and would be significantly harder to do from the perspective of the anti-ginger government.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Suppose another system: A technocracy. In this system, castes are created based on some IQ metric. By this means, there are quite literally first, second, third, and fourth-class citizens. Is this a problem? Clearly, we would consider it a problem in a geostate. In addition to the difficulty of finding agreed-upon metrics, most modern societies agree that at least in principle “equality of opportunity” is desirable. A caste system of any kind may stand in the way of that.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">However, it seems to me that the existence of these caste societies would pose no serious problem in a polystate. Personally, I am dubious that such a system would work well, but in that case it’d be my right not to join such a society. Indeed, if you were to meet someone of the lowest rank in such a society who hadn’t yet switched out, you could assume that he had no problem being a bottom-rung caste member. Although you might find his life an unhappy one, it is at least voluntary. Voluntary unhappiness seems to me to be a reasonably good descriptor of most people, so I don’t see it as a particular problem for the polystate.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Let’s suppose an even uglier system. Suppose there was a system that allowed slavery. The WS-1 rules would not prohibit this development. Is that a problem? I believe it is not, for two main reasons. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The first reason is that there can never be true slavery in WS-1, in that the so-called slaves would be there by consent. They would have to recognize the system and declare themselves a part of it. That is, if there were slavery, it would have to be non-coercive to some extent.<a href="#calibre_link-60">(9)</a> Thus, whatever “slavery” existed in WS-1 would not be slavery in the usual sense of the word.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In the history of American slavery, stories abound of supposedly “well-behaved” slaves who would suddenly run away, to the surprise of their masters. It is not a surprise to anyone now. If people were willing to become criminals, pursued by the state, subject to vigilante justice in order to escape slavery, how much more likely would they be to escape if they could do so with the click of a button? Even if people were willing to enter into these contracts, WS-1 effectively limits formally legal slavery engagements to 1 year.<a href="#calibre_link-61">(10)</a> In addition, it seems to me very likely that if there nevertheless were slave anthrostates, most governments would consider slaves to be refugees, much as modern geostates do. That is, the easy availability of “migration” in the polystate would constrain the possibility of slavery. Between the voluntary nature of the system and the overlapping of societies, hyper-discriminatory systems would be hard to enforce on those who dislike them.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It could well be noted that this is all fine and good for adults, but might pose a problem for children. These leads me to the second reason I believe allowing “slavery” systems is acceptable. If there really were anthrostates that exercised forms of slavery that were of questionable consent, it is likely that other anthrostates and organizations would stop it by force. That is, the existence of a polystate by no means obliges you to ignore that your neighbor is behaving heinously. In fact, in a polystate, such behavior would be harder to ignore than it is for current geostates. Overlapping anthrostates would have to countenance horrible acts in a way separate geostates often do not. The sufferer on television simply does not provoke the emotional response of the sufferer next door.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Similar arguments could be made regarding, for example, a system that explicitly finds women inferior. One suspects such a system would, it goes without saying, have trouble attracting many women. Many polls of modern geostates that ask men and women about anti-woman laws regularly find that men and women hold divergent opinions<a href="#calibre_link-62">(11)</a>. That is, if the choice of home “country” were wide open, sexist societies would have a lot of trouble holding on to women. Nevertheless, it would likely be the case that societies that affront the Western liberal mindset would exist. That such societies are (especially in their extreme form) distasteful, I take for granted. But, most would agree that so long as the women involved are behaving voluntarily, nothing unjust is occurring.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Much like with the consent rules for children, it might be noted that individuals could be “brainwashed” into living in distasteful societies. This may well be true, but it’s certainly no worse than in geostate situations. In fact, it might be better &mdash; at least in a polystate, it would be readily possible to see how other people live.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">One other possibility that might be noted is a situation in which some group is not accepted by any anthrostate. That, is, suppose that redheads are so generally despised that no group will accept them. I think this situation somewhat unlikely, but I do believe the polystate system would handle it better than a geostate. In the first place, a Red-Headed League could be formed in which redheads abide their own rules. But, more importantly, any system which cleansed itself of redheads would be at risk of losing a fairly large portion of its population, both of redheads and ginger-sympathizers. That is, governments that can very easily lose their citizens might be less inclined to alienate even small groups.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It might be argued that this assumes governments behave rationally. Indeed, the Nazi government’s alienation of many of the greatest scientists in history provides evidence that some societies are perfectly capable of acting against their economic self-interest. That said, in the case of those great scientists, the nature of the polystate would have at least made it easier for them to escape, and would make the creation of a centralized persecution apparatus much more difficult.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Thus, I think that although the polystate system would allow discriminatory systems, this would be ameliorated by the voluntary nature of the system, and by the economic and social disincentivization against discrimination. In addition, if someone chooses to persist as a low-caste citizen in a society, despite having the frequent option to leave, it at least seems to me that the ethics of the system cannot be assailed on either utilitarian or consent-based ethical grounds.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph5"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-21"></a><span class="char-style-override10">Chapter 7: Healthcare</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />Healthcare is a fairly specific issue, but it has great political importance in our time. So, perhaps it merits its own brief discussion.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In particular, healthcare is a good way to explore a potentially serious free rider problem. No doubt, in a polystate, there would be many different levels of social safety net. Suppose you have one anthrostate that provides a high level of completely socialized healthcare and another anthrostate that is a minimal government. Assuming hyper-rational actors, the most prudent choice in life might be to stay in the minimal government (or at least, in a lower taxing government) until you start to feel sick. On average, in WS-1, you’ll only have to wait 6 months before switching anthrostates. Since most diseases don’t kill you that quickly, you’d be best paying low taxes until sick, then switching and soaking up healthcare rewards once you’re ill. By this means, it might be argued that governmental provision of healthcare would be prohibitively expensive. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">My speculation is that there are a few ways this issue could be solved.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">First, people of conscience might exist. I don’t wish to have this book be too science-fictional, but it is possible such individuals walk the Earth. If they do exist, you might simply expect them to pay into a system and take their fair share out later. There is no welfare state that does not assume some shenanigans will occur &mdash; the question is the size of the cost. If the vast majority of people are fairly honest, or too busy to invest the effort it would take to cheat, the few who attempt to game the system may not matter much.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Second, anthrostates could enact laws insisting that benefits only go to long-term citizens, or to citizens who’ve paid in a certain amount. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Third, there could very well arise “soup kitchen” anthrostates that organize around the principle of helping the poor. For example, it is conceivable that there could be a Christian or Fabian anthrostate that structures itself such that all people are given welfare no matter what their condition, or at what cost to well-off citizens. I think this proposition is both probable and very interesting in its potential consequences as time grows large. In a polystate system, citizen loyalty would be a very prized commodity. For this reason, in the long term, a state that does the most to help the tired, poor, huddled masses might well rise to prominence.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph5"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-22"></a><span class="char-style-override10">Chapter 8: Privacy and Censorship</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />Let us take for granted that WS-1 will have an Internet. I think there are two questions that might arise &mdash; (1) is it possible for all members to be secure with their information? and (2) with free societies overlapping with controlled societies, is a controlled society possible?</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The first question is, of course, a question for geostates as well. As I write this chapter, the United States may be about to enter a diplomatic argument with the EU over whether the American NSA wiretapped European offices. That said, the issues of the polystate may be somewhat different. For example, suppose I wish to send a message to Sally. The message is routed through property owned by Adolf (for example, a mail truck or an email server). Sally and I are staunch libertarians who think the message is inviolable. Adolf is a totalitarian who feels it is the duty of his state to open the message. In this situation, how is the mail treated?</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In a geostate system, you must simply accept that if your mail goes through a questionable geostate, questionable things may happen to it. In a polystate of significant complexity, it is conceivable that there would be no efficient way to route messages without at some point dealing with these problematic anthrostates. In fact, for this to be true, we need not assume totalitarian states run by people named Adolf. Many nominally liberal Western nations not only practice surveillance of citizens, but keep secret the level of surveillance. It is likely that a similar situation would exist in a polystate.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">One possible result would be that the polystate would produce anthrostates that are more liberal and transparent. A conceit of this book is that a polystate system puts more onus on the state to obey the will of its citizens. It’s possible, if perhaps a bit naive, to suppose that the various anthrostates would be more transparent with citizens if those citizens can easily immigrate. If you are British, you must accept the compromise between liberty and security that your representatives (who admittedly embody the will of the people to some extent) have struck. In a polystate, it might be the case that some percentage of citizens agree to be scrutinized harder for reasons of security, while others wish none at all, and most wish to be in the middle.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In such a situation, it’s conceivable that mail transmission could be achieved by inter-anthrostate agreements. That is, liberty-minded countries could make an effort to work together to provide message transmission services. Those less concerned with these issues could willingly forego these rights. By this means, my letter to Sally would not ever have to fall into the hands of an Adolf. In addition, non-state mail-carriers could develop to suit these needs by privacy guarantees. These carriers could be much like UPS, FedEx, Ontrac, and others, with the addition that they wouldn’t exist inside geostates, and therefore wouldn’t be subject to any single government.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">This framework’s virtues may raise a problem for those who are security-minded: If a government can only wiretap the people who accede to wiretapping, it won’t do much good against terrorism in the polystate at large. It would be very tempting for a security-minded anthrostate to cast a broader net. Those concerned most with liberty might be willing to accept a larger death toll from terrorism than those most concerned with security. However, a terrorist’s bomb doesn’t ask for one’s political affiliations.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">I’m not entirely sure how this problem could be resolved. That said, the speculation I’ve expressed throughout this book is that the majority of anthrostates (by membership) would be liberal republics. Given the recent history of such republics, I consider it likely that the vast majority of anthrostates would allow some sort of snooping on mail. It could be argued that potential terrorists would necessarily not be part of the major governments, but then this is a problem for geostates as well. And, not incidentally, many of the most infamous terrorists were members of some large geostate at the time of their most heinous crimes. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">To take the argument from the other side, this framework may cause problems for the liberty-minded. After all, it’s never oneself who needs surveilling. It’s always the other person. If the major anthrostates are anything like today’s geostates, they will be interested in spying on foreign governments. By this means, perhaps everyone will be surveilled. By virtue of the fact that a polystate setup makes it far harder to cordon off geography, it may be that nobody who chooses to interface with the rest of the world is safe from snooping. It is not entirely clear to me that, in practice, this would end up substantially different from modern geostates. However, it is almost certainly the case that there is an extent to which the level of surveillance over a citizen is tied to that citizen’s geostate of residence. In a polystate, the overlapping of systems might result in a more surveilled society than any that exists in the world today.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">This may be unresolvable. The only defense I can think of here is this: If we accept that we are in a panopticon, the remaining issue is how the panopticon uses its data. That is, assuming I didn’t mind a camera in my home<a href="#calibre_link-63">(12)</a>, the issue becomes how widespread the video feed becomes. In a polystate, there is a market for governments. So, between two surveillance states, I may well pick the one that’s more responsible with its data.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">That said, recent events lead me to be more convinced that privacy violations are not a highly researched issue for most people. If the citizens of the biggest anthrostates don’t in general care about privacy issues, then the market of governments won’t result in more privacy.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The second issue I raised was whether the nature of the polystate constrains the existence of more policed states. That is, if the Chinese and American Internet overlap, what use is it for China to censor material? </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">To answer this, one must consider why those censorship laws exist. There is no law forcing me to eat candy bars. There doesn’t need to be. Censorship laws exist because people want to see things that other people do not wish them to see. If you are a citizen of China and wish to see images of Tiananmen during the student protests, your best options are to do something illegal or to emigrate. In a polystate system, you would probably have better choices &mdash; you could switch to an uncensored system entirely, or you could even switch to a version of your China-style system that has less censorship. That is, if the censorship laws of the China-style system were unpopular, people would just leave. The residual group of people still in the system would necessarily be people who feel that they should be restricted in their media options. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">So, although the overlapping of societies might restrict the ability to censor information, it would not necessarily constrain censorship. It would only constrain voluntary membership in censored-media societies, and the range of behaviors of those members in a generally uncensored society. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph5"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-23"></a><span class="char-style-override10">Chapter 9: Public Property and/or Private Property</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />I believe public property might pose a difficulty for polystates. At the very least, the system would have to be substantially different from the geostate system. I am not certain it would be different in a desirable way, but here I will speculate as to how it might work.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">First, let me deal with the trivial case of whether an anthrostate could, within itself, have a system of public property. This would of course be possible. In common usage, “public” property means something more like “property of the state.” To a good approximation, public land can be thought of as private property of the nation, public property within the nation. So too would it work in WS-1. Anthrostates having public property would be the same as corporate entities owning property in modern-day geostates. There might well be some practical differences in how this works (for example, McDonald’s doesn’t have an army, so far as I know), but the system per se poses no contradictions.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">A more difficult case would be public parks. Most people believe that it is good to have wildlife preserves. We rightfully believe that if Yosemite were auctioned off, much if not most of it would go to people who would not preserve it in its pristine form. It might be argued that if people really wanted wildlife preserves they’d be willing to pony up the money. However, a well-developed sense of ethics and a well-developed stock portfolio are not always tightly correlated. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Suppose we assume that the existence of state-owned wildlife preserves is an intrinsic good. If so, I think we have to assume that this is one way in which a polystate system contains an intrinsic bad quality. Although I think it is very likely that wildlife preserves would exist in a polystate (I am certain there would be many anthrostates devoted to environmentalism), it is likely they would not be able to buy as much property as might be desirable.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">There is a reasonably good economic defense of this &mdash; that public lands may cost more than they benefit the public, especially when the aggregate citizen (myself included, if I’m being honest) would often rather go to Disney World than to Yosemite. Considering what benefit might be had to the lower and middle classes by opening up cheap land, it could be argued that the preservation of certain beautiful ecosystems is not a good economic move purely in dollar terms. Perhaps this is so, but then again, if a majority of people thought the works of Monet would make good kindling, the paintings would still merit protection. Microeconomics-style analysis is unsuited to this task, in my opinion, largely because there is probably not a good way to determine a value or dollar figure for natural areas on which individuals place literally infinite value.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Still, I will say this in defense of the way WS-1 might handle wildlife preserves &mdash; it is perhaps good to make citizens at some point put their money where their mouths are. It may be that part of why I don’t believe the auctioning of Yosemite would end well is because citizens do not expect, based on their life experiences, to have to lay out personal money to preserve certain lands. In addition, we shouldn’t necessarily think of the simple case of the auctioning of Yosemite. If only 3-5% of societies were pro-environmental, they might well make it the business of a century to acquire as much land as possible. By this means, it’s conceivable that over a long time scale, the polystate might even have more public land than a typical geostate does today. Unfortunately, this is an “as time goes to infinity” solution to a problem that is in many cases short-term. There might be more wildlife preserves as time goes to infinity, but there might be a lot less wildlife, too.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Another difficulty might be roads. These, however, I think could be handled amicably. It may surprise the reader to learn that private highways exist in many countries, from the USA to France to Japan. In a polystate, an anthrostate could act as a corporation to accomplish roadbuilding, or corporations within and between anthrostates could create highways. The polystate might, however, pose a few complications. For example, if one anthrostate has drivers always on the right side of the road and another has drivers always on the left, there would be an increase in accidents. I think it likely that this would not long be a problem. USB cords work in thousands of devices without a governmental authority insisting on it. But, even if we suppose an extreme case &mdash; say, an anthrostate theocracy that insists that the only ethical way to drive is on the left side of the road &mdash; it is likely that other anthrostates or private owners would not link roads with those people.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Other potential differences, such as speed limits or road construction standards, could also be resolved amicably by similar means. To the extent that roads would have differences, that information could be made public. And, as someone who has taken long road trips in the American Southwest, I can say that on I-10 alone there is considerable quality variation in highways within a single country. Dr. Roederer tells me I-95 provides sizeable variation even within the state of Virginia.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In addition, non-standardization might open the option for a bit more variety in roads. In the modern world, roads are standardized based on the width of two cart-pulling animals established millennia ago. In the future as cars become more autonomous, multiple road widths, or technology-embedded roads, might become the norm. In that case, there may be a benefit to a lack of top-down standardization.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">One other problem might be tolls. In a polystate, a person driving long distance might encounter toll roads taking many different currencies. The answer to this problem has already been discussed in the larger <a href="#calibre_link-18">chapter on currency</a>.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It might be asked at this point what the nature of private property is without an overarching state regulating it. That is, suppose Alice and Bob both claim the same land and are from different anthrostates. How is this to be resolved? I believe this question has to some extent been answered in other sections by the notion that an anthrostate will have the force to defend the property rights of its constituents. The general problem of complex arbitration has already been mentioned. However, one additional question worth noting is the potential abuse of property within the anthrostate in order to generate geostates.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">That is, suppose anthrostate A claims a thin ring of land that is 100 miles in radius and then disallows movement through the ring as “trespassing.” This would cause serious problems for the other citizens trapped inside the ring, and restrict resource usage by anthrostates outside the ring. How is this to be resolved?</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">One possibility would be to simply add a polystate rule against enclosure; a good rule might be something like “no property of one anthrostate can be used to impede the motion of other anthrostates.” This rule would require some interpretation, but could be workable.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Another possibility would be that, in practice, it would simply not be desirable to form these sorts of rings. In a polystate, trapping of one anthrostate’s citizens would likely be an inducement to war or diplomatic sanction. Assuming a decent amount of overlap of anthrostate populations, the ring maneuver is something like the terrorist’s bomb discussed earlier. That is, it is not an advisable action at the level of a government because the victims of the action may be from many anthrostates. Encircling a large area of land might very well entrap dozens if not hundreds of citizens of different countries. It’d be something akin to trying to take over the UN. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It is also possible that in a polystate there would be normative opposition to internal geostates, which an encirclement might be seen to represent. The impedance of movement in a large region would be something like casting law over geography rather than over people. In a long-term polystate, this might well become a taboo. That is, the culture that would develop in a polystate might render this problem moot.<a href="#calibre_link-64">(13)</a></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">One other factor worth noting is that the ability to switch governments yearly might make the whole idea of encirclement pointless &mdash; or at least rather silly. If I find myself encircled by anthrostate A on November 1, I have only to wait 60 days to join anthrostate A. At that point, I proceed across the circle and out into the wide world, and 365 days later I can switch anew. 425 days is a long time to wait, but it is practically an instant in bureaucratic time. This necessarily fails if anthrostate A doesn’t, for example, allow citizens to leave their homes. It’s not clear to me why anyone would join such a state, but supposing a few do it is still unlikely they would be able to impose their odd rules against a powerful state. In that case, our encircled citizen could escape by joining a large state (perhaps a large belligerent state), which would quickly secure his freedom by some means.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Lastly, on the note of public property, it’s probably worth discussing the ultimate in public properties &mdash; air and sea. In more abstract terms, what I want to get at are externalities and common goods.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">For externalities, in particular I want to talk about airborne pollution. There are many externalities, but the logic of how pollution-limiting might work should apply generally. So, let’s consider two cases where airborne pollution might be a problem &mdash; one extreme, the other more likely.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The extreme case would be a rogue government. Let’s imagine a government created by evil Ebenezer Scrooge types, called PU (Polluters United). PU has 1 citizen, who exists to allow PU to exist, but contains the private property and operations of 10,000 corporations. PU emits half of the carbon dioxide in the entire polystate. They won’t change because they aren’t compelled to internally, and who in the world would start a war with them over externalities? In addition, despite having 1 citizen, PU commands a great deal of financial power with which it can hire security. This is, I think, a worst-case scenario that might occur to many readers.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">I would say first of all that such a group should be fairly easy to embargo, if there is political will on the part of other nations. In the case of a rogue government as extreme as PU, I think such an embargo is likely. That is, although the polystate permits coal plants, it would be within the power of the various anthrostates to economically isolate them and the people who work with them.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The reader might well note that this assumes many governments will behave ethically, and that assuming a large group will behave ethically is not very prudent. However, I don’t believe the above depends on ethical behavior. Rather, the embargo would result from the polluted air being undesirable. In a polystate, it’s entirely possible that the PU factories would be somewhat distributed among the citizens of other nations. That is, as in WS-1, people would be confronted with the behavior of other nations. Only a concern for its people’s interest, or the regard of their constituency, would be needed to impel a politician to cut ties with PU.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Let’s consider the more likely and potentially more problematic case of a large powerful anthrostate unwilling to agree to an externality-limiting arrangement. For example, suppose there is an anthrostate that contains 10% of the polystate population, and which refuses to sign a CFC-limiting accord. If they produce enough CFCs, the arrangement will be moot even if every single other anthrostate signs on. I don’t know that there’s a good solution to this, however the situation is very similar to the geostate situation. Consider the response of the US and Canada to the Kyoto Protocol. In fact, it’s conceivable that in the particular case of the Kyoto Protocol, in which (if you believe the surveys) the majority of North Americans wanted the agreement ratified, the polystate system would’ve done more to limit emissions by giving citizens more choices.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">One more case to consider is that of simpler externalities. Suppose, for example, PU also dumps mercury into a lake that is partially the property of non-PU people or entities. In that case, what you have is essentially a crime perpetrated by one anthrostate upon another, which could be resolved as discussed previously in the <a href="#calibre_link-16">chapter on crime.</a></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The last area I want to consider on the topic of public property is common resources. Let’s consider the example of whaling rights. In the modern geostate system, whaling rights are fairly strictly constrained, with most nations voluntarily limiting the number and type of whales their citizens can hunt, if not banning whaling altogether. The situation might be a bit different for a polystate in that a polystate can’t make a geographic ban, as for example exists currently on Southern Ocean whaling.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">However, I believe in practice it would end up about the same. One way this might work would be to claim the whales as property of an anthrostate or common property of a number of anthrostates. That is, if three quarters of all polystate citizens want a moratorium on hunting these species, their nations could simply assert ownership of the whales. If a pro-whaling anthrostate were to kill such an animal, it would be an international crime. In other words, if many powerful anthrostates wish to protect common resources, they could simply become the protectors of those resources by demonstrating that the violation of those resources would result in an international incident, which could result in serious sanctions of some sort.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph5"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" /><span class="char-style-override10"><a id="calibre_link-24"></a>Chapter 10: Tax Evasion/Manipulation</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />In WS-1, I stipulate a one-year changeover period under most circumstances. This is a relatively short time period, which might impose some problems for the collection of taxes. Specifically, three problems occur to me &mdash; (1) Tax evasion by changing anthrostates before collection can occur, (2) Anthrostatic tax havens, and (3) difficulty of collection of sales tax.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In the first case, let’s imagine Bob who hates paying taxes. Bob, however, does not wish to live under a low-tax anthrostate, as he enjoys getting state services. So, Bob comes up with a bright idea &mdash; skip paying taxes this year, then before he gets in legal trouble, switch to a similar anthrostate to which he does not owe taxes.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">I think the solution for the Bob problem here is pretty easy. Anthrostates could simply create laws that limit people’s ability to game the system. For example, services could be made contingent on previous payments. This might hurt poor people who are often the object of government services, so the contingency could be tied to income. That is, everyone gets the same service in exchange for a certain percent of income. Similar anthrostates could also gather together to enforce each other’s tax rules. Based on his behavior, Bob may only wish to live in certain types of anthrostates. Those anthrostates could simply agree that tax cheats will be punished within a multi-anthrostate system.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Let’s now suppose Bob has exhausted most of the anthrostates he likes, so he comes up with a new scheme. He’ll use as many services as he can, then at the end of the year he’ll switch to a minarchist state with low or no taxes, and which will not punish Bob for back taxes he owes to another country. In this situation, Bob may well “win,” but he does so at a very high price. He must spend the rest of his days in a government he dislikes, and which perhaps his friends don’t esteem highly, all in exchange for a few years of discounted government services. Simply put &mdash; assuming people care what system they exist in, the price of cheating could be easily made high enough to limit bad behavior.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It’s conceivable that this effect could benefit the polystate overall. Consider that people who consistently cheat could get washed out of systems that are hurt most by cheating, into systems which are hurt least by cheating. It may be the case that few citizens want to live in a libertarian paradise, but it is also the case that there is probably not much money to be made in defrauding a minimal government.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Let’s consider the second problem I raised &mdash; tax havens. For example, suppose our tax cheat Bob sets up an independent state &mdash; Bobtopia. He has his friend, Lawless Frank, be the only citizen of Bobtopia. Although Bob is a member of a social democracy, he has his income routed into an account in Bobtopia. Bobtopia has no taxes, but has its currency pegged to the social democracy of which Bob is a citizen. Thus, Bob gets the services of his anthrostate, but because he has no income, he pays no taxes. Depending on how heavy his taxes are, he might be able to offer a substantial bonus to Lawless Frank.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">This situation is more or less isomorphic to the modern geostate world, at least for wealthy people who can offshore their accounts in the Cayman Islands. In addition, at least in this hypothetical, Bob’s money is probably not very safe in Bobtopia, as Boptopia has no resources with which to make Bob whole if his money is stolen.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Let’s then consider the more likely case of a professional tax haven anthrostate. Suppose Bob creates an anthrostate called BobCorp. BobCorp has only one citizen &mdash; Bob. BobCorp employs hundreds of digital security experts and only deals in digital money. BobCorp has a small fee for holding onto money, but otherwise has no taxes. How are regular anthrostates to protect themselves?</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">I believe once again this is similar to geostates. There will probably always be small states willing to act as tax havens for wealthy individuals in return for a small fee. The potential downside of the polystate is that, due to its overlapping state nature, it might be easy for everyone to have a tax haven. Currently, tax havens are the province of the rich who have enough money and wherewithal to get them. But, imagine if BobCorp had an ATM on every block. Why wouldn’t everyone use it?</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">This may pose a problem in the form of a constraint on taxes in anthrostates, but I don’t believe so. In fact, it would at least have the silver lining of making tax evasion rather democratic. That is, if everyone can avoid taxes very easily, including people who are not politically connected, anthrostates would be forced to confront the issue. This could be done in ways mentioned earlier, such as embargo laws. It could also be accomplished by having all taxes occur at the point of service. At the moment, this would probably mean a flat tax, but it is conceivable in a sufficiently advanced (and financially surveilled) society, progressive or regressive tax schemes could be accomplished at the point of service. Anthrostates could also come up with more rigorous accounting methods requiring their citizens to turn over all of their banking records, and taxing their overall income and wealth, rather than merely that wealth contained in their own system. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It is worth noting that not all human beings are Bob. Although I don’t like what taxes do to my bank account, I do like many of the services they fund. It is entirely possible that in a polystate, due to my free choice of governments I would be happy about the majority of the uses of my tax dollars. This might make me unlikely to cheat on my taxes, even if it were a ready possibility.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Lastly, let’s consider consumption and sales taxes. That is, let’s consider taxes at the point of sale. Suppose for example that Bob creates a right-libertarian anthrostate called Bob’s Gulch, which has a flat consumption tax on all goods. In Bob’s Gulch, Bob creates a chain of stores called Bob-Mart. He believes his right-libertarian anthrostate will result in his having the lowest prices. Meanwhile, Alice lives in Inc-A, which is a state that has no taxes other than a very high income tax on individuals. She opens a chain called Alkea. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Because Inc-A has no consumption tax, whereas Bob’s Gulch does, Alkea is consistently able to charge lower prices at the point of sale, even though Alkea is in a more taxed anthrostate. In other words, the polystate might create a system in which the ability to have a point-of-service tax is constrained by the nature of competition. This constraint is potentially bad because it doesn’t clearly benefit anyone, and at the same time it limits anthrostate variety.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In practice I believe it wouldn’t pose a problem, at least in the long term. Why? Because in the long-term, the citizens of Inc-A get really really screwed. They pay a high income tax to make up for the lack of a sales tax. The citizens of Bob’s Gulch pay no income tax, and then get Alkea products without paying a sales tax. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In a sense, the question of consumption tax might become very similar to the question of tariffs in geostates. When a nation raises a tariff on a good, it is essentially protecting one group of people (those who work with the good or in related areas) at the expense of another group (everyone else). For example, if China wishes to sell cheap tires to Americans, a high tariff on tires protects tire people, but removes the benefit to everyone else of cheap tires. In the case of Inc-A, their corporations might get a benefit at the point of sale, but that benefit would be to the detriment of their citizens. Similarly, Bob’s Gulch has a system that benefits their citizens, but potentially harms their corporations. Therefore, it seems to me that at equilibrium you’d expect most states to employ a number of kinds of taxes to limit these sorts of problems.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In addition, it should be noted that sales tax is not the only factor in the mind of a consumer. For example, many people would not want to buy food from a company in an anthrostate with few or no food safety standards. It is probable that discussions on the relation of consumption behavior and consumption tax cannot be reduced merely to the sticker price. Just as I trust Toyota more than Ford to make a quality car, I might trust the food made by companies in an eco-democracy over the food made by companies in a fascism.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph5"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-25"></a><span class="char-style-override10">Chapter 11: Ungoverned People</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />The polystate allows for the existence of entirely ungoverned people. I do not believe this poses any problem beyond normal forms of lawless behavior.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">First, it should be noted that very few people wish to live a lawless existence. As I write, there are a number of nations (or at least, war zones with agreed-upon borders) that effectively have no law. One suspects the immigration rate is rather low. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">That said, the polystate system might be a bit more amenable to lawless individuals than a lawless geostate. For example, if you exist in no anthrostate, you may still be able to use the money, services, and protection of some anthrostates around you. But, you probably would also be barred from many opportunities for commerce or employment. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Especially when you consider that a polystate would probably contain a variety of ultra-minimal governments, the option to be utterly lawless would not be very appealing to many people.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In fact, even if you were a sociopath bent on murder and with no regard for law or common decency, it seems unlikely you’d want to be lawless. If lawlessness is the exception to the rule, it is probable that such people would be held in suspicion. Suppose, for example, anthrostate NoMu has only one law (no murder) and yet a person still chooses to not exist in any anthrostate.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Additionally, having no government effectively means you have no legal protection. As discussed previously, crimes between anthrostates would require (at least) two parties to arbitration. If a person from anthrostate A commits a crime against a lawless individual, who is to say that anthrostate A cannot force the lawless individual to obey the law of anthrostate A? The lawless individual has no protection against any system. It should be considered that because the polystate permits all forms of government, anthrostate A could be a government that allows corporal punishment or execution for minor crimes.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In a certain sense, lawless individuals already exist in geostates. In a number of voluntary<a href="#calibre_link-65">(14)</a> victimless crimes (e.g., prostitution, drug dealing, loan sharking) in many Western geostates, a class of lawless individuals are created. That is, a loan shark can’t call the police to get his money back. He can rely on social codes, or simply on the fear he instills in clients, but he cannot bring the power of the state against people who break agreements with him. At least in the matter of his business, the loan shark is lawless, as is the prostitute whose client won’t pay and the dealer who was shot while dealing.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It may be debated whether these lawless individuals pose a serious problem to society as a whole. However, they do exist, and so this may be a case where in some sense the geo and anthro systems are the same. In addition, for reasons stated above, total lawlessness might well be less common in a polystate system.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph5"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-26"></a><span class="char-style-override10">Chapter 12: War</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />In many of the previous chapters, I’ve tried to argue that some phenomenon would be more or less the same between geostates and anthrostates. I think war is one area where the difference would be very large. Because this difference is very large, speculation about how war might work in a polystate is probably unwise. For that reason, although war is a very large area for discussion, I will try to limit myself to some observations on why war should be very different in a polystate, as opposed to how it would be different.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The most apparent way war would be different is that &mdash; at least at the outset of a war &mdash; it wouldn’t be clear who held what territory. The closest geostate analogy might be a civil war. But, even in the case of civil war, factions are often regional, and spheres of influence are established quickly. However, this is only possible when there is a small number of non-overlapping factions. In a polystate, it is possible that over any radius the size of a small city, there will be dozens if not hundreds of anthrostates. This complicates matters.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Suppose Anthrostate A1 goes to war with Anthrostate B2, and that (for simplicity) neither has any allies or sympathizers. Let us also suppose, as Clausewitz does, that the end of war is the disarmament of the enemy. It seems to me there are four ways the war can be accomplished: (1) Selection of a pre-determined fighting area, (2) Street-to-street fighting with care taken not to harm non-warring anthrostates, or (3) “Peaceful” evacuation of non-warring anthrostates, followed by fighting in a more traditional manner. (4) Fighting heedless of the consequences.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The first case would be simple enough, though it doesn’t seem likely. Or, if not unlikely, it at least presents an absurd situation in which parties to the war agree to fight en masse, then either use state property or rented property from another state to execute the battle.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The second case (fighting street to street) is possible, but would be risky geopolitically in a way that typical geostate war is not. War in this sense would have to be something more like large-scale targeted assassination than what we usually think of as war. Even that might be dangerous, as a stray bullet or uncontrolled conflagration might represent an international incident. In this situation, almost all conventional weapons would have too high of a collateral damage risk to be useful. Most explosives would be too dangerous, as would automatic weapons. Innocent victims are a part of all war, but in the case of the polystate, innocent victims might represent an entirely new faction entering a war in progress. Whether a new faction would enter a war would be very much subject to the belligerence of the harmed nation, the level of collateral damage done, and the clarity available to determine who is at fault. It may be the case that accidentally killing a citizen of a major government would not result in all-out war. However, as the last hundred years demonstrate amply, the difference between total war and total peace is not binary.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">On that basis, it seems to me that case three (evacuation of non-combatants) is a bit more likely. If B2 went to war with A1, B2 would perhaps do its best to find the highest concentrations of A1’s citizens and/or leaders. Especially if B2 was in the stronger political position in the polystate, B2 might be able to urge an evacuation of an area. More realistically, if a state of war seems to exist over a geographical area, those who can evacuate will evacuate. If so, any war lasting long enough might automatically result in a clear field of battle.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Case four, in which the two factions do not heed the higher risk of collateral damage, may unfortunately be the most likely. If a nation feels existentially threatened, or if its citizens have a particular view of conflict, they may not care for any of the reasoning pointed out above. If someone is coming to kill my family, the optimum location and population dynamic for combat will not be high on my list of concerns. If the typical nature of combat is that the fear of collateral damage to third parties is not a serious one, then polystate war would probably be different, but no less prevalent than geostate war.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">With all that said, as I noted earlier, war in the polystate seems to me to be very complicated, and so far I’m only talking about the case of two factions. In a polystate, which would contain many similar states, two-party war is perhaps unlikely. It is also entirely possible that in a state of total war, anthrostates might declare temporary geostates for the duration. In this situation, the determining factor might simply be the polystate culture and its attitude toward this sort of behavior. It’s entirely possible that once war commenced, it’d be prosecuted much like war always has been. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Although it is difficult to say how war might be prosecuted, some of the political aspects might be interesting to discuss. The political difficulty of war is discussed in the first book as a potential upside to a polystate, so I won’t belabor it much here. The gist is this: If an anthrostate makes war, it risks rapidly alienating a large segment of its population, especially if the war is generally perceived as unjust. In a system where it is easy to leave, it would be very hard to make war without the will of the people.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">I can think of two important counters to this somewhat rosy notion &mdash; first, that people are subject to propaganda, and second, that in the long term, warlike individuals might sort into certain anthrostates that might thus become very dangerous.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The case of propaganda is obvious enough, though propaganda is often hard to maintain in the long run. In his memoirs, Siegfried Knappe recalled that even in highly propagandized Nazi Germany, soldiers quickly learned to differentiate victory from defeat because newsreels used the term “heroic” whenever there was a loss. And in any case, the avoidance of war weariness is difficult even in times of general military success. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">That said, it should be noted that the possibility of mass defection during war might perversely result in leaders trying to prosecute wars very quickly and aggressively, which might make things worse in the short term of warmaking.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The case of personality sorting is more interesting, but perhaps difficult to predict. It could be imagined that any time a nation goes to war, there could be people eager to join and fight. On this basis, and on the basis of the reputations achieved by anthrostates, over time highly warlike nations might emerge. This is entirely possible, though it may be the case that warlike nations do not persist for long in a modern world. Modern warfare is more and more determined by technology and economics. If North Korea is any example, a permanent war culture may not be conducive to good science or the generation of prosperity. In addition, even if there were these warrior states, they would still be subject to the constraints above.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In summary, it seems to me that although war in a polystate is hard to understand or speculate about, the nature of the system probably presents some inertia against large-scale fighting.</p>

			<p class="Basic-Paragraph5"><span class="char-style-override9"><br class="calibre2" /><br class="calibre2" /><br class="calibre2" /></span>In writing Book 2, I purposefully put myself in the position of a skeptical apologist. That is, I start with the conclusion that a polystate could work, then try to explain why, while keeping an eye out for the limits and biases of my imagination. However, by and large, the discussions in Book 2 do not treat normative questions. I have tried to stick largely to trying to understand what might happen and not to judge what should happen. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In doing so, I came up with a number of issues that are insoluble, usually because they have an ethical character. That is, if you consider it immoral to co-exist in the same polystate as a fascist dictator, WS-1 won’t do for you no matter how well I speculate about the economics of it.<a href="#calibre_link-3">(1) </a></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">“Polystate” was written mostly because I think it’s an interesting thought experiment. At the same time, it also seems to me that it is a system that, in some form, will be tried at some point. As information technology improves, individuals more and more expect customized experiences. When I go to a website now, I get information tailored to my interests. If I want a soda, I can go to Amazon and select from thousands of options. As 3D printers and programmable matter become more common, almost all objects may be subject to the whims of individuals. I think it is only a matter of time before people begin asking for customizability in the frameworks of their governments.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">If it is something that’ll be tried in the future, it’s something we should think about now. If it contains insoluble problems, it’s probably good to locate those problems and figure out how they might be ameliorated, avoided, or at least reckoned with.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Many of the topics to follow have been treated in some form, or have been touched upon in general by discussion of other areas. For that reason, and because the problems are generally normative and therefore above my pay grade<a href="#calibre_link-4">(2)</a>, I am going to list them here with only limited discussion. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph5"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-28"></a><span class="char-style-override10">Bureaucracy Explosion</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />As I have discussed in some previous sections, a number of the workings of a polystate could potentially result in a great need for more officials whose job is only to navigate the complexities that result from a society with many overlapping governments. If a polystate necessarily requires more such individuals, the conversion of a geostate to a polystate system could at least in this sense be thought of as an economic loss.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It’s conceivable these problems could be ameliorated by better technology, which could take the place of many somewhat mindless duties that nevertheless currently require humans.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It’s also possible to imagine a way polystates could limit internal anthrostate bureaucracy by making governments more accountable to citizens. It could also be the case that a profusion of small governments would require fewer internal employees than a large body with the equivalent number of citizens. But, this is hard to speculate on well. As C. Northcote Parkinson said, “...it is manifest that there need be little or no relationship between the work to be done and the size of the staff to which it may be assigned.”</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Nevertheless, the need for an expanded amount of bureaucracy, as I believe is likely to exist in a polystate, would cost money directly and create the potential for indirect loss through corruption and rent seeking. If so, the polystate might still be worth it if the afforded freedoms were valued enough by citizens. In addition, it is possible that in the long term, the need for bureaucracy would lessen if over time citizens coalesced around a small number of governments or government types. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph5"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-29"></a><span class="char-style-override10">Constraints on Social Security via Age Sorting</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />This may seem specific, but I think it’s important. In many Western economies, it pays to be old. This hasn’t yet induced anyone to manufacture pro-aging creams or to bring comb-overs into high fashion, but it may well induce some ire among the young. Social security systems work on the premise that young people pay in while young and receive payment back when they get older. But what if people age sort their anthrostates?</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">A rational short-term-thinking young person might prefer a more libertarian society on the basis that she probably doesn’t need health insurance. Anthrostates could insist that one must pay in what one gets out or one must pay in for a time period before taking out, but it is entirely unlikely these policies will make an 18-year-old think rationally about life 50 years from now. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It may also be the case that elderly people are attracted specifically to systems that cater to their needs by providing high social security and healthcare. The elder-centric system might not persist for long without going bankrupt. In other words, if the young have differential preferences of a certain kind, in the long term, social security might not be possible.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">That said, the above assumes that people will behave ultra-rationally (at least in the short term) and will not act charitably toward their elders. If people are not ultra-rational, as is widely believed outside of economics, they may simply not tend to care to switch out of their parents’ systems. It may also be the case that charitableness isn’t necessary for young people to exist in these systems. Suppose, for example, that in the first 50 years of a polystate the more minimal societies prove to be less stable. That might result in many young people gravitating toward more standard systems. In addition, if the modern world is any guide, young people on average tend to favor expanding the welfare state in a way that probably costs them in the short and medium term. That is, what is not economically rational may still be socially fashionable. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">These questions all have to do with one’s view of human nature and of responsibility to fellow citizens. Social security might well be constrained by the tendency (or lack thereof) for people to behave generously toward strangers when uncoerced. For those who believe social security is necessary to an ethical state, this constraint may pose an insoluble problem.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">This problem of age-assorting of social security states in specific might well be extended to any notion of future planning by any anthrostate in general. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph5"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" /><span class="char-style-override10"><a id="calibre_link-30"></a>De-Integration of Society</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />One of the good and bad things about a large nation is that you are in the same ship of state as a lot of people who are nothing like you. This may mean society isn’t what you want it to be, but it also may mean you are compelled to learn how other people think.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It is probably the case that the availability of infinite splintering of governments would lead a polystate to in some sense be more fractured than a geostate. For example, different economic systems, different public property systems, and different healthcare systems might lead to groups of people who live near each other but can essentially ignore each other’s existence. This is, of course, already the case to some extent in every geostate, but the polystate might splinter even further. It is not clear to me what the effect of this would be or whether it is desirable or not. The polystate would at least have the saving grace of limiting regional disparities based on manmade borders.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph5"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-31"></a><span class="char-style-override10">Ethical Co-Existence</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />Is it ethical in general to live next door to a person whose society allows vivisection of animals? This would be the sort of question you might have to ask yourself in a polystate. Mind you, at this moment unethical things are happening in pretty much every country on the planet, and I don’t think most of us feel we’re either directly responsible or personally tainted by them. However, it seems to me there’s something viscerally different between knowing North Korea starves its citizens and knowing that the family next door beats their children. I pay taxes to neither<a href="#calibre_link-5">(3)</a>, and I approve of neither, and yet proximity and direct awareness make a great deal of difference to me.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">A related example to which the reader may be less sympathetic (this is an eBook, after all) is ethically tech-free or ethically tech-low societies. There could very well be a paleolithic style anthrostate, in which members are prohibited from using tools created in the last 10,000 years. Even if members were capable of this, they would find it very hard to avoid at least interacting with technology. I may live like a caveman, but my technocratic neighbor can surveil me from his arduino quadcopter, which rather ruins the experience.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">There is probably no way to resolve this, other than perhaps in some version of the private property nature reserves mentioned earlier. However, one wonders how well a paleolithic society that does not engage with other societies would be able to hold onto its property in the long term.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">I suspect that in a polystate there would still be broad norms. And, as discussed earlier, the overlapping of societies might speed the homogenization of norms. But it would also mean that an individual at any point in time would live in the same “state” as another individual committing unethical acts. It is not clear that this would be acceptable, regardless of any benefits gotten in the trade-off.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph5"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-32"></a><span class="char-style-override10">Mob Rule</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />One of the pros of the polystate I’ve suggested is that it makes government more beholden to citizens, as the citizens are readily able to leave government. However, this could result in an odd sort of mob rule in which leaders are so beholden to citizens (and their perception of citizens, and their perception of citizens’ perception of them, and so on) that the wise or educated have no ability to exercise discretion or prudence. By analogy, imagine the difficulty of raising a child if that child were able to leave you for some other parent quickly and for any reason. You might be tempted to dole out the candy a bit more regularly.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It may be noted though that the citizens of a state are not children and government is not a parent. I suspect the extent to which this is seen as a problem depends on one’s view of democracy and of loyalty to one’s nation. One man’s mob rule is another man’s polity. And, if a society is indeed a mob rule in all the ways that those words signify, it will soon find itself without a mob to do the ruling.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph5"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-33"></a><span class="char-style-override10">Sacred Locations</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />Are locations and nations inseparable? Civilization, as we think of it, is not much older than 10,000 years, and all modern geostates are much younger. And yet, almost all nations, religions, ethnicities, and creeds, however young, tie their history to important locations.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">Suppose there were a strip of land claimed by group A to be the origin place of their messiah and claimed by group B to be their ancestral homeland. Let us also suppose these two groups hate each other. Both have a metaphysical attachment to this particular location. As such, it’s possible that neither party would be amenable to a polystate system on the mere basis that it would mean, in a sense, that one’s own party doesn’t have a geographic right to that location. Imagine how a devout Muslim might feel knowing that the Kaaba was in some sense private property that could be lost. Or, imagine that same Muslim being unable to restrict the movement of infidels in the area of the Kaaba.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">In other words, in the case where individuals consider ethnicity/religion/culture and a part of the planet to be linked inseparably, the polystate’s allowance for free movement of citizens may pose a dilemma.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">I should admit, I’m somewhat dubious of the ties between location and nation. One wonders whether fewer wars would have been fought if Jerusalem were a mental state and not a city. That said, it cannot be denied that to many if not most people, the love of a location and its history cannot be disentangled from the idea of nationhood. This may pose a problem for the polystate, especially in the short term. People may feel a personal kinship with locality and be uncomfortable with the idea that their part of the world no longer has a defined boundary. In the case of sacred locations, the right for the individual to visit may not be nearly as important as the right for a state to control. This would not be impossible to do via private property, but it would be more difficult in a polystate, especially if the claimed sacred area is large.</p>

			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />If anyone in the polystate is in a society that permits the carrying of guns, nobody in any anthrostate is “free” to live in a gunless society. This is true for all weapons, but guns are a good embodiment of the issue. In a polystate, the near-certain existence of anthrostates permitting concealed weapons means that everyone exists in a state that permits concealed weapons. Short of some very impressive technological developments, the potential added danger of weapons is probably unavoidable without further constraints being placed on the entire polystate. This danger is certainly unavoidable in WS-1.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph5"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-35"></a><span class="char-style-override10">Startup Costs</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />It may be the case that the cost of starting certain forms of anthrostate would be prohibitive, even if they would be good in the long run. Most new states, if they were at all modern, would have some fairly large upfront costs in terms of computing and location purchases. In the modern world, most very large projects which don’t have a clear economic benefit (e.g., large works of art, outer-space travel, particle colliders, etc.) are accomplished by governments because it is hard to get the needed capital from private individuals and groups. If the creation of a new system were a very expensive undertaking, it might require similar investment. However, it is unlikely that one government will use its taxpayers’ money to create a competitor government.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">We can easily conceive of low-cost systems, or ways to implement expensive systems piecemeal, but the upfront cost might limit some not-yet-imagined government formats. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph5"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-36"></a><span class="char-style-override10">Transition </span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" />Even if all the above difficulties were dealt with, the issue of transition from geostate to polystate may be unethical, as it would probably result in violence, and given the history of revolutions, might well result in failure. That is, even if a polystate seems desirable compared to your geostate, the process of change might represent too high a cost for the change itself to be desirable. It is probably the case that a polystate would limit the concentration of power, and therefore it is probable there would be resistance.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">The only way around bloodshed I can imagine would be the creation of new territory, either by artificial means or by the colonization of other celestial bodies. For the moment, these both seem to be distant possibilities.</p>

			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" />For the purpose of simplicity, I have centered this book around a minimal polystate, and so most of the arguments herein are crafted for that setting. However, most if not all of the bad things (and good) mentioned above could be marginalized by having a more extensive polystate. The options are infinite and are therefore useless to argue over here, but some interesting ideas to spark your imagination might be these &mdash; illegalization of war, illegalization of private property, illegalization of guns, guaranteed income, changeover time of 10 years, instant changeover, limiting number of states to 100 overall, yearly constitutional congresses, common currency, and common judiciary.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">By expanding the rules, you will necessarily restrict variety. However, when it comes to danger, prejudice, and censorship, to name just a few issues, variety is not necessarily desirable. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">One particularly interesting possibility is the creation of a polystate-style tax code. For example, suppose each year you are told “you must pay x dollars in taxes,” and then are given a set of options for where the money goes (perhaps with non-discretionary payments to things like military and infrastructure). It would be interesting to see how the public chooses differently from its representatives. I don’t know precisely what the results would be of such a system, but I suspect it may at some point be tried. </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">And that is the note I would like to close on. I freely admit, if tomorrow a polystate were set up somewhere, I would not join. I would excitedly read about it, and would love to visit, but I’d like to see it actually work for oh... 50 years or so before I join the party.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">That said, part of why I wrote this book is that I think the idea, if workable, would have many good consequences. A reading of the last few centuries shows us that idealized government forms typically fail in practice, regardless of theories of their good and bad qualities. As Burke wrote, “They who destroy everything certainly will remove some grievance. They who make everything new have a chance that they may establish something beneficial.” </p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It is probably the case that, much like a surgeon operating on a poorly researched animal, any change is likely to do bad, and any great change may kill the patient. And yet, most of the governments the readers exist in are the products, at some level, of philosophers and economists who proposed different ways of living. I would never claim (certainly not in writing) to be either a philosopher or an economist, but I do think the polystate is an interesting concept with a great deal of potential good in it. As a puzzle and as a possible benefit to society, I think it warrants discussion, and perhaps even a limited trial somewhere by some means.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph2">It is my sincere hope that a few people will find this book to be as interesting a topic as I have, and will use the above chapters as a primer for discussion. Bertrand Russell once said the difference between science and mathematics is that the former concerns “what is,” while the latter concerns “what would be if.” This is more of a speculative social science, which makes it “what might be if, but maybe not?” In other words, it is fertile ground for debate.</p>

			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><span class="char-style-override10"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" />FOREWARD</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph7"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-1"></a>(1) The author is well aware that he is, by and large, talking about the wealthiest portion of living humans. However, as global affluence increases and the Internet becomes completely ubiquitous, this paragraph should hold true for more and more people.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" /><span class="char-style-override10">BOOK 1</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph7"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-41"></a>(1) To give a counterpoint, Enrico Moretti has convincingly argued in The New Geography of Jobs that locality has persisted in importance even in the age of the Internet because of the value of shared information between local networks of experts. It will remain to be seen if this effect persists as the Internet matures. I admit, as a cartoonist, I have been very surprised by the number of cartoonists who live and work in Brooklyn, Portland, and San Francisco, even though their incomes are not geographically determined. Considering the cost-of-living difference between Brooklyn and, say, Birmingham, this location choice is something like cutting one’s disposable income by two-thirds. Moretti might suggest this has to do with these networks, though no doubt status and personal predilection are very important. Nevertheless, to the extent that face-to-face meetups remain important, technology may eventually overcome location. There is no reason in principle that the time taken by the trip from Los Angeles to Paris could not be reduced to the time of a car commute in 2013 from the suburbs to the city.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph7"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-42"></a>(2) Note, this is true even though the hyper-tolerant individuals receive a positive externality, as they are protected from other people’s drunk driving. After all, both groups are protected, but only the hypo-tolerant individuals are protected from themselves.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph7"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-43"></a>(3) It is fair to note that a rich person may effectively buy himself a different set of tax laws and services, but at least nominally the same tax system applies to every citizen, whose fortunes may wax and wane. It could also be noted that most Western or Westernized states nowadays have progressive tax systems and welfare systems that apply differently to different people. Although this is true, the same set of laws still applies to everyone. That is, a millionaire who goes broke is entitled to welfare, just as a poor person who becomes rich is still obligated to pay more.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph7"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-44"></a>(4) I use this term to mean a minimal state that has property rights.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph8"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-45"></a>(5) Unless otherwise modified, by “anarchy” I mean a complete lack of state, including a lack of property rights.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph8"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-46"></a>(6) I use syndicalism to refer to the system outlined in the book Anarcho-Syndicalism: Theory and Practice by Rudolph Rocker. A rough sketch of the idea is “the replacement of the state and of state economic systems by trade union cooperatives.”</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph8"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-47"></a>(7) That is, for 200 anthrostates, there are 19,900 possible interactions. To a good approximation, if you square the number of anthrostates, you get the number of possible interactions. Thus, the number of interactions becomes unwieldy very quickly. That said, as my computer scientist friend, Dr. Alex Roederer, notes, “the fact that this is quadratic means to me the growth in complexity is manageable.”</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph8"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-48"></a>(8) I say “nominally” here because it is open to debate whether a true Communist society has ever existed.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph8"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-49"></a>(9) It would perhaps be more prudent to cite something Hayek said here, but I wish to make it clear that the polystate idea is not to my mind aligned with any particular political ideology. The cited book by Russell advocates Guild Socialism.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph8"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-50"></a>(10) It should be noted that this effect could create problems. Removing all pacifists from a society no doubt would change the nature of that society immeasurably, while equally and oppositely affecting those systems to which the emigrants flee. Such effects are hard to predict, so I will leave them to the reader’s imagination.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" /><span class="char-style-override10">BOOK 2</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph8"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-52"></a>(1) By “aggregate individual” I mean something like “the average person.” That is, in a polystate where 9/10 of people are social democrats, 1/20 are monarchists, and 1/20 are libertarians, the aggregate individual is a social democrat. To put it another way &mdash; if there were some metric by which you could score the prominence of a state in the life of the individual, the aggregate individual would have the average score.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph8"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-53"></a>(2) The law is a bit more complicated, but the simplified case will suffice for this discussion.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph8"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-54"></a>(3) American drone strikes notwithstanding.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph8"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-55"></a>(4) Suppose, for example, the USA had been an anthrostate at the height of the Vietnam War.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph8"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-56"></a>(5) This is true even for states (in fact, especially for states) that disallow private property. Community-owned buildings, for example, might be part of the territorial dispute.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph8"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-57"></a>(6) Just to be perfectly clear &mdash; the author personally doesn’t see these as serious issues. However, many people do, and the author is (he’s told) fallible. Also, note that the author is a redhead, which information will shortly be useful.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph8"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-58"></a>(7) One notes the frequency with which so-called terrorists are in the victimized country legally.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph8"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-59"></a>(8) I will reuse this word regularly. If you think it not sufficiently strong, let me add “repulsive,” “repugnant” and “antisocial” to its meaning.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph8"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-60"></a>(9) I’m told that in BDSM culture, such relationships already exist and are highly formalized. Although I would personally never desire to participate in such a system, whereas it is entirely consensual it seems to be no business of mine. That said, no doubt there are many who believe such systems are necessarily criminal. Issues such as these are discussed in the chapter on crime and punishment.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph8"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-61"></a>(10) This is not to say it is an optimal system. A great deal of lasting harm can be done in a year (or a day for that matter), but it is still superior to slavery on a permanent basis.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph7"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-62"></a>(11) <a href="http://www.pewforum.org/Muslim/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-women-in-society.aspx#views">http://www.pewforum.org/Muslim/the-worlds-muslims-religion-politics-society-women-in-society.aspx#views</a></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph8"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-63"></a>(12) This seems more a danger to society than to myself.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph8"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-64"></a>(13) This may be wishful thinking, but I felt I should mention it since my original idea for this book was a work of fiction in which the above maneuver is the setting. That is, a group in a worldwide polystate attempts a geostate. The plot (perhaps someone who’s better at long stories can take it up) was that a rogue group cleverly homogenized the population of an area and then declared a geostate.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph8"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-65"></a>(14) I say “voluntary” with the understanding that almost nothing is purely voluntary, in the sense that social and economic circumstances can compel individuals to behavior they find undesirable. I mean voluntary only in the sense that both parties to a transaction can walk away from it if they desire, regardless of the damage that doing so may entail.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph"><br class="calibre1" /><br class="calibre1" /><span class="char-style-override10">BOOK 3</span></p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph8"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-3"></a>(1) Having worked in the movie industry for some years, I can say that you probably already exist in a nation with fascist dictators of a sort, but you may take comfort knowing that at least they aren’t legally recognized as such.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph8"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-4"></a>(2) Spoiler Alert: this book does not solve the gun rights debate.</p>
			<p class="Basic-Paragraph8"><br class="calibre1" /><a id="calibre_link-5"></a>(3) Or, at least, if by some means my tax dollars help the abusive parents next door, those dollars don’t support the violence per se, and in any case money is not nearly the majority of my concern.</p>
