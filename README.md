# HTML / GitHub upload

This book was written by [Zach Weinersmith](http://www.theweinerworks.com/). **I, [Stuart P. Bentley](http://stuartpb.com/), did not write this.** What I *did* do was run it through [Calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) and upload it to GitHub to, [in the author's own words](https://twitter.com/ZachWeiner/status/438097029730803712), "responsibly pirate" and share it by making it freely available, to read and share and hyperlink and remix, to the greater Internet community.

# Conversion notes

This was converted from the AZW3 file [available from Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00IM5EM7W/) to HTMLZ using all Calibre's default settings, then the HTMLZ contents were unzipped and added in Git.
